to set up a switch port to support both:
	Data traffic (VLAN 10) for a connected PC
	Voice traffic (VLAN 20) for an IP Phone

Connection Layout:
1.	PC is connected to the IP Phone (via the PC Port on the phone).
2.	IP Phone is connected to the Switch (via the SW Port on the phone).
This allows the switch to handle data and voice traffic on the same physical port, while logically separating them using VLANs.

When both a PC and an IP Phone share a switch port:
1.	PC Traffic (VLAN 10) is untagged and treated as normal data traffic.
2.	Voice Traffic (VLAN 20) is tagged using 802.1Q and prioritized using QoS (Quality of Service).

The switch identifies which traffic belongs to which VLAN:
	Untagged traffic goes to VLAN 10 (default access VLAN for the PC).
	Tagged traffic from the IP Phone goes to VLAN 20 (voice VLAN).

Configuration :
    1.	Access the Cisco Switch
            switch> enable
            switch# configure terminal

    2.	Select the Port Connected to the IP Phone
            switch(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/1

    3.	Configure the Port for Access Mode
            switch(config-if)# switchport mode access

    4.	Assign Data VLAN (VLAN 10)
            switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10
    This ensures all untagged traffic (from the PC) is placed on VLAN 10.

    5.	Enable Voice VLAN (VLAN 20)
            switch(config-if)# switchport voice vlan 20
    This allows the switch to recognize tagged packets from the IP Phone as VLAN 20.

    6.	Enable QoS for Voice Traffic Prioritization 
        switch(config-if)# mls qos trust cos
    mls qos enables Multi-Layer Switching Quality of Service (QoS) on the switch.
    trust cos tells the switch to trust the Class of Service (CoS) value from incoming packets (set by the IP Phone) and prioritize voice traffic over regular data traffic.
    It ensures voice packets (which are latency-sensitive) get higher priority in the switchâ€™s internal processing.    

 Verified the configuration by:
    Switch#show vlan brief
