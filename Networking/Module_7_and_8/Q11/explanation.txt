An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of rules used to filter traffic on a Cisco device (such as a router or switch). 
It controls which packets are permitted (allowed) and denied (blocked) based on specific conditions like IP addresses, protocols, and ports.

Implementing and Testing ACLs to Restrict Traffic Based on Source and Destination Ports

ACL on a router to:
1.	Allow HTTP traffic (port 80) from a specific source (PC1 - 192.168.1.10).
2.	Block Telnet traffic (port 23) from another source (PC2 - 192.168.1.20).
3.	Allow all other traffic to ensure no unintended blockage.

Step 1: Configure IP Addresses
    On PC1 (Allowed Source)
        IP Address: 192.168.1.10
        Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        Gateway: 192.168.1.1
    On PC2 (Blocked Source)
        IP Address: 192.168.1.20
        Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
        Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Step 2: Configure the Router
1.	Access the router and enable configuration mode:
        Router> enable
        Router# configure terminal
2.	Set up the router interface connected to the switch:
        Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
        Router(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
        Router(config-if)# no shutdown
        Router(config-if)# exit

Step 3: Create and Apply the ACL
1. Allow HTTP (Port 80) from PC1:
        Router(config)# access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.1.10 0.0.0.0 any eq 80
2. Block Telnet (Port 23) from PC2:
        Router(config)# access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.20 0.0.0.0 any eq 23
3. Allow All Other Traffic:
        Router(config)# access-list 100 permit ip any any

4. Apply the ACL to the Router's Interface (Inbound Traffic):
        Router(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
        Router(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in
        Router(config-if)# exit
        Router(config)# end
        Router# write memory

Step 4: Testing the ACL
From PC1 (Allowed HTTP Traffic)
1.http://192.168.1.1
  Output :host name unresolved
From PC2 (Blocked Telnet Traffic)

1.	Open the command prompt and initiated a Telnet session (port 23):
    telnet 192.168.1.1 23
    It displayes blocked by foreign host
Verify ACL Hits on the Router
Check if the ACL is working by monitoring packet matches:
    Router# show access-lists 100

    The matches show that router is inspecting traffic and applying the rules.
