The native VLAN is the VLAN on a trunk port that carries untagged traffic.
By default, on Cisco switches, the native VLAN is VLAN 1.
Both ends of a trunk must have the same native VLAN; otherwise, a VLAN mismatch occurs.

Native VLAN importance :

Ensures untagged traffic is processed correctly.
Supports backward compatibility with devices that donâ€™t support VLAN tagging.
Required for management protocols like CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) and STP (Spanning Tree Protocol).

Changing native vlan ,for that we have to ensure the native VLAN is the same on both sides of the trunk.

On Switch 1:

    Switch1(config)# interface fa0/2
    Switch1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
    Switch1(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99
On Switch 2:

    Switch2(config)# interface fa0/2
    Switch2(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
    Switch2(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99

Check if the fix works:

    Switch1# show interfaces trunk

TO simulate mismatch, we can change the navtive vlan on one of the switches and we can see the error as:
    %CDP-4-NATIVE_VLAN_MISMATCH: Native VLAN mismatch detected on Fa0/2 (99), with Switch2 Fa0/2 (88).

For troubleshootingwe can revert the native vlan.
