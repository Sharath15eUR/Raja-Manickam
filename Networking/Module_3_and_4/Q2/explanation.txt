1. I set  Up a Simple Network in GNS3 with 2 vpc and a switch.
2. I configured ip addressess and started capturing the link between switch and each pc using Wireshark.
3. I have pinged pc1 from pc0 and observed the packet transfer.
4.First it send arp req in broadcast and resolves the destination mac address then it send ICMP requests and reply follows.
5.In the Ethernet frame we can see details like 
    Destination MAC Address: The MAC address of PC2.
    Source MAC Address: The MAC address of PC1.
    EtherType: Identifies the protocol (e.g., 0x0800 for IPv4).
    Payload: Contains the ICMP (ping) request/reply.
    FCS (Frame Check Sequence): Ensures data integrity.

    Field	                 Value	                               Size
    Destination MAC	        00:50:79:66:68:00	                 6 bytes
    Source MAC	            00:50:79:66:68:01	                 6 bytes
    EtherType	            0x0800 (IPv4)	                     2 bytes
    Payload (ARP Data)      Address Resolution Protocol info	28 bytes (ARP)
    Frame Check Sequence	Not shown (usually 4 bytes)	        (Captured later)
