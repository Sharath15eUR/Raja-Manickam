1.I created a virtual bridge br0 which acts as virtual switch which allows interfaces to communicate with each other.
2.I created 2 new virtual dummy interfaces dummy0 and dummy1 and connected them to the bridge.
3.I checked the bridge status using the bridge link show command. The output confirmed that both dummy interfaces were successfully added to br0
4.I assigned the IP address 192.168.100.1/24 to the br0 bridge. This allowed the bridge itself to be reachable on the network.
5.I used the bridge fdb show command to check the MAC address forwarding table. Both dummy interfaces were correctly listed as part of the bridge. 
  This table shows how the bridge keeps track of which devices (MAC addresses) are connected to which interfaces
6.To monitor traffic, I ran tcpdump on br0. However, no packets were being captured. 
  This showed that the bridge was not forwarding traffic between the dummy interfaces.  
7.I tried to ping dummy1 from dummy0 using their assigned IP addresses. but the ping failed with 100% packet loss

8.I tried creating virtaul interface pairs veth and tried doing the same, still ping dosen't work.
