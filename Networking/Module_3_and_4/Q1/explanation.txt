1.I have created a network with 3 pc and a switch in cisco packet tracer.
2.Configured unique ip address to each pc and started simulation mode.
3.I have pinged pc3 from pc1 and observed the traffic.
4.Also while analysing the ethernet frame (layer2) ,we can see the source and destination MAC address.
5.Also checked the MAC address table of the switch to see the connected devices.
