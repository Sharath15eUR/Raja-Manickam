Class of Each IP Address:
The class of an IP address is determined by its first octet (the first 8 bits), and based on this, we categorize IP addresses into different classes (A, B, C, D, and E). The classes relevant to your question are A, B, and C.

1. 192.168.10.5:
First Octet: 192
Class: Class C (IP addresses from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255)
Private/Public: This is a private IP address because the range 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 is reserved for private use according to RFC 1918.

2. 172.20.15.1:
First Octet: 172
Class: Class B (IP addresses from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255)
Private/Public: This is a private IP address because the range 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 is reserved for private use according to RFC 1918.

3. 8.8.8.8:
First Octet: 8
Class: Class A (IP addresses from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255)
Private/Public: This is a public IP address because Class A addresses can be used for both private and public networks, but this specific IP (8.8.8.8) is assigned to Google's public DNS service.


Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used to map private IP addresses to public IP addresses when devices on a private network access the internet. 

NAT Device (Usually a Router):
The NAT device, typically your router, is responsible for handling NAT. The router has:
Private IP address on the internal network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
Public IP address on the external interface, which is provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) (e.g., 203.0.113.10).

The Process of NAT:
Step 1: Private Device Makes a Request:
Let's say PC1 (with a private IP address 192.168.1.5) wants to access a website. It sends a request to the router.
The packet contains the source IP (192.168.1.5) and the destination IP (the public IP of the website).

Step 2: Router Modifies the Packet (Source NAT):
The NAT-enabled router receives this packet and sees that the source IP address is private (192.168.1.5).
The router replaces the source IP address of the packet with its own public IP address (203.0.113.10), because private IP addresses cannot be routed on the Internet.
The router also keeps track of the connection (by maintaining a translation table) so it knows which internal private IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.5) the request came from.
The router forwards the modified packet with its own public IP (203.0.113.10) as the source address.

Step 3: Internet Communication:
The modified packet, with the router's public IP as the source address, is now able to reach the destination website.
The website responds to the router's public IP address.

Step 4: Router Receives the Response:
The response from the website comes back to the router's public IP address (203.0.113.10).
The router looks up its NAT table and finds that the response was originally sent from PC1 (with private IP 192.168.1.5).
The router then modifies the destination IP address of the response packet to PC1's private IP address (192.168.1.5), and sends it back to PC1.

Step 5: PC1 Receives the Response:
PC1 receives the response from the website, but it sees the packet as coming from its own private IP (192.168.1.5), as if the website directly communicated with it.
