The original network address 10.0.0.0/24, which has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (24 bits).
To divide it into 4 subnets, you need to borrow 2 bits from the host portion of the address his is because 2^2==4, 
which is the number of subnets you need.
Borrowing 2 bits from the host portion will increase the subnet prefix from /24 to /26.
Therefore, the new subnet mask will be /26, which corresponds to 255.255.255.192.

Subnet ranges :
Now that we have a /26 subnet mask, the network is divided into 4 subnets. The range of IP addresses for each subnet will be:

Subnet 1:

    Network Address: 10.0.0.0/26
    First IP: 10.0.0.1
    Last IP: 10.0.0.62
    Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.63
    Valid Host Range: 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.62

Subnet 2:

    Network Address: 10.0.0.64/26
    First IP: 10.0.0.65
    Last IP: 10.0.0.126
    Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.127
    Valid Host Range: 10.0.0.65 to 10.0.0.126

Subnet 3:

    Network Address: 10.0.0.128/26
    First IP: 10.0.0.129
    Last IP: 10.0.0.190
    Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.191
    Valid Host Range: 10.0.0.129 to 10.0.0.190

Subnet 4:

    Network Address: 10.0.0.192/26
    First IP: 10.0.0.193
    Last IP: 10.0.0.254
    Broadcast Address: 10.0.0.255
    Valid Host Range: 10.0.0.193 to 10.0.0.254

Also set up network with 4 pcs each from different subnet connected to a switch which in turn connected to a router..
A router is needed since switch cannot route traffic between different subnets.
When a device want to communicate to another device beyond its subney it forwards to default gateway(router)..I also assigned default gateway fro each pc in diffent subnet
The connectivity was verified.
