I configured communication between two routers and their connected PCs by assigning appropriate IP addresses and setting up static routes.
PC1 Configuration:
    IP Address: 192.168.1.10

    Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

    Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 (Router1’s interface)
PC2 Configuration:

    IP Address: 192.168.2.10

    Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

    Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1 (Router2’s interface)
I configured the router by assigning ip address and static route
1.Router 1
    enable
    configure terminal

    ! PC1 interface
    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown

    ! To Router2
    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/1
    ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
    no shutdown

    ! Static route to PC2 network
    !This tells Router1 to send all traffic destined for the 192.168.2.0/24 network to Router2 through the 10.0.0.2 interface.
    ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
2.Router 2
    enable
    configure terminal

    ! PC2 interface
    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0
    ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown

    ! From Router1
    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/1
    ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
    no shutdown

    ! Static route to PC1 network
    !This tells Router2 to forward all traffic meant for the 192.168.1.0/24 network to Router1 via 10.0.0.1.
    ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1

For Router-to-Router Links (10.0.0.x/30):
    I used a /30 subnet (255.255.255.252) for the connection between the routers. 
    This subnet provides exactly 2 usable IP addresses—one for each router. 
    It’s the most efficient choice since only two devices need to communicate.
After configuring, we can view the interface status status by : show ip interface brief and route by show ip route.

In PC , to check the connectivity I used ping and verified using tracert.
