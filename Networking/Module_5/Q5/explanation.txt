Connection:
I added 4 pc to a switch via fastEthernet ports(2-5) and connected the switch to router fa0/1 to gig 0/0
I configured the pc's with approprite ip address, subnet and default gatewat

Router Configuration:
    
    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0
    no shutdown
    exit

Configure sub-interfaces for each VLAN:

    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0.10
    encapsulation dot1Q 10
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192
    exit

    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0.20
    encapsulation dot1Q 20
    ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192
    exit

    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0.30
    encapsulation dot1Q 30
    ip address 192.168.1.129 255.255.255.192
    exit

    interface gigabitEthernet 0/0/0.40
    encapsulation dot1Q 40
    ip address 192.168.1.193 255.255.255.192
    exit

A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical subdivision of a physical network. 
It allows you to create multiple separate networks within the same physical infrastructure

When a switch supports multiple VLANs, it uses the IEEE 802.1Q standard to tag Ethernet frames. This tag identifies which VLAN the packet belongs to.

    Access Port - Connects to end devices (PCs, printers) and is assigned to one VLAN.
    Trunk Port- Connects switch-to-switch or switch-to-router and carries multiple VLANs by adding VLAN tags.
    In Router-on-a-Stick, the router's physical interface is a trunk port that uses sub-interfaces for each VLAN.

Working example:
PC1 (VLAN 10) wants to communicate with PC2 (VLAN 20).

Traffic from PC1 reaches the switch via Access Port and is tagged with VLAN 10.

The switch forwards the tagged packet to the router via the trunk port.

The router processes the packet on sub-interface fa0/0.1, routes it to sub-interface fa0/0.2 for VLAN 20, and sends it back to the switch.

The switch removes the VLAN 20 tag and delivers the packet to PC2.    

Switch Configuration:

Creating VLANs and assign ports:
    vlan 10
    name VLAN10
    exit

    vlan 20
    name VLAN20
    exit

    vlan 30
    name VLAN30
    exit

    vlan 40
    name VLAN40
    exit

Configure trunk port (connects to the router):
    interface fastEthernet 0/1
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40
    exit

Assign PCs to specific VLANs:
    interface fastEthernet 0/2
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 10
    exit

    interface fastEthernet 0/3
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 20
    exit

    interface fastEthernet 0/4
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 30
    exit

    interface fastEthernet 0/5
    switchport mode access
    switchport access vlan 40
    exit

Verification:

Check router sub-interfaces:

    Router# show ip interface brief

Check switch trunk status:

Switch# show interfaces trunk

TO verify Fa0/1 is in trunking mode and allows VLANs 10, 20, 30, 40.



Later to check connectivity among pc in different subnets,we can ping and verify them.
