If the device already has an IP address,so forcing a new DHCP request by releasing and renewing it:
    On Linux (Kali/Ubuntu):

    sudo dhclient -r && sudo dhclient

    On Windows:

    ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew

In wireshark select the network interface connected to the router ( Wi-Fi) and apply this filter:
    udp.port == 67 || udp.port == 68

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication between clients (e.g., your device) and DHCP servers.

    Port 67: Used by the DHCP server to receive requests from clients.
    Port 68: Used by the DHCP client to receive responses from the server.    



Observations :
    
DHCP Release:
    Client → DHCP Server: Sends a DHCP Release message.
    DHCP Server: Marks the IP as available in its pool for reuse.

DHCP Discover:

    Client broadcasts a request to find a DHCP server.
    Source IP: 0.0.0.0 → Destination IP: 255.255.255.255 (Broadcast).

DHCP Offer:

    DHCP server responds with an available IP address and lease details.
    Source: DHCP Server IP → Destination: Client MAC address.

DHCP Request:

    Client accepts the offered IP and requests to lease it.
    Source: 0.0.0.0 → Destination: 255.255.255.255.

DHCP Acknowledge (ACK):

    DHCP server confirms the lease, and the client starts using the IP.
    Source: DHCP Server IP → Destination: Client’s new IP.
