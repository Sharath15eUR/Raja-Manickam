I captured ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets on Wi-Fi interface using Wireshark.
    1.ARP Request (Frame 14)
      This is a broadcast message sent to the entire network because the  device does not  know the router’s MAC address as it was not in arp cache.

    2. ARP Reply (Frame 15)
    This is a unicast reply message from router containing its MAC address to the device.

Role of sender's Ip and MAC addressess in these packets:
    1.The sender’s IP and MAC uniquely identify a device on the local network.It enables devices to translate IP addresses (Layer 3) into MAC addresses (Layer 2) for communication.
     When a device wants to send data , it needs the MAC address of that IP to create the Ethernet frame.

    2.The sender’s IP and MAC address are stored in the ARP cache of receiving devices.

    3.Helps in diagnosing network problems by analyzing the sender’s IP and MAC.
     You can identify misconfigured devices, IP conflicts, or unresponsive devices.
     If two devices send ARP replies with the same IP but different MACs, there may be an IP conflict.
