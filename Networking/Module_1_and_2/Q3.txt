1.Wireshark

Wireshark is a GUI-based network protocol analyzer that captures and filters packets.
Wireshark provides two types of filters:
Capture Filters – Applied before capturing packets in specific network interface.
Display Filters – Applied after packets are captured to focus on specific packets.

2.TCPDump is a command-line tool and packet sniffing tool for capturing network packets.
    1.	Capture all packets on interface eth0:
     sudo tcpdump -i eth0
    This command captures all network packets on the eth0 interface.

    2.	Capture only ICMP (ping) packets:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
    Filters packets to only capture ICMP (ping) traffic.

    3.	Capture packets from a specific IP:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 src 192.168.1.100
    Only captures packets originating from the IP address 192.168.1.100.

    4.	Capture packets to a specific IP:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 dst 192.168.1.200
    Only captures packets that are being sent to the IP address 192.168.1.200.

    5.	Capture TCP traffic on port 443 (HTTPS):
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 443
    Filters packets to only capture traffic on port 443, which is used for HTTPS communication.

    6.	Save captured packets to a file for later analysis:
    sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
    Writes the captured packets to a file named capture.pcap for further analysis.

    7.	Read captured packets from a file:
    sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap
    Reads and displays the packets stored in the capture.pcap file.
