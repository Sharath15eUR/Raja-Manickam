Prameters in ifconfig :

Interface Name: The name of the network interface,  eth0 (Ethernet) or lo (Loopback).
flags: Shows the status of the interface, such as UP (enabled), BROADCAST (supports broadcasts), RUNNING (interface is active), and MULTICAST (supports multicast traffic).
mtu: Maximum Transmission Unit, which is the largest packet size that can be sent over the network.
inet: The IPv4 address assigned to the interface.
netmask: Defines the subnet mask, which determines the network and host portions of the IP address.
broadcast: The broadcast address for the network, used to send data to all devices in the subnet.
inet6: The IPv6 address assigned to the interface.
prefixlen: The length of the network portion in an IPv6 address.
scopeid: Defines the scope of an IPv6 address, such as link-local (only valid within the local network).
ether: The MAC (hardware) address of the interface.
txqueuelen: Transmit queue length, which affects how many packets can be queued for transmission.
RX packets: Number of received packets.
RX bytes: Total data received in bytes.
RX errors: Number of errors encountered while receiving data.
RX dropped: Packets dropped due to buffer overflow or network congestion.
RX overruns: Packets lost due to the interface being unable to handle incoming data fast enough.
RX frame: Frame errors, usually related to misaligned packets.
TX packets: Number of transmitted packets.
TX bytes: Total data transmitted in bytes.
TX errors: Errors encountered while sending data.
TX dropped: Number of dropped packets during transmission.
TX overruns: Packets lost because the transmission buffer was full.
carrier: Indicates carrier signal issues, such as cable disconnection.
collisions: Number of packet collisions on a shared network, common in half-duplex networks.
