Wi-Fi backhaul refers to the method used to connect access points (APs), routers, or other networking devices to the main network (internet gateway or core network). 
It is the communication link between the Wi-Fi access points and the internet.
Backhaul is essential because it determines network speed, stability, and coverage by ensuring that Wi-Fi devices are properly connected to the internet.

Types of Wi-Fi Internet Connectivity Backhaul:
1.	Wired Backhaul -  Uses physical cables like Ethernet or fiber to connect Access Points (APs) to the router or core network.
    - Example: Home networks with fiber-optic internet and Ethernet-wired routers.
2.	Wireless Backhaul -  Uses Wi-Fi links to connect APs without cables, often in mesh networks.
    - Example: University campuses or large office spaces using wireless mesh backhaul for seamless connectivity.
3.	Cellular Backhaul -  Uses 4G/5G cellular networks to provide internet access.
    - Example: Rural areas or mobile hotspots using 4G/5G backhaul for connectivity.
Your Home/College Wi-Fi Backhaul and Properties:
•	If you use Fiber Internet at home, then your backhaul type is Wired (Fiber Backhaul)
    - Properties: High-speed, low latency, stable connection, supports Gigabit speeds.
•	If your college/university has a large Wi-Fi network with multiple access points, it likely uses Wireless Backhaul (Mesh Network)
    - Properties: Supports seamless roaming, multiple APs connected wirelessly, flexible deployment.

How Backhaul Affects Wi-Fi Performance
    A strong backhaul (like fiber or wired Ethernet) provides a stable, high-speed internet connection.

    A weak backhaul (like congested Wi-Fi or cellular networks) may cause high latency, slow speeds, and dropped connections.
