Differences Observed Between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi :

Protocol & Wi-Fi Standard

    5 GHz: Uses Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)

    2.4 GHz: Uses Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)

Network Band

    5 GHz: Operates on 5 GHz

    2.4 GHz: Operates on 2.4 GHz

Network Channel

    5 GHz: Channel 157

    2.4 GHz: Channel 8

Link Speed (Receive/Transmit)

    5 GHz: 866/866 Mbps

    2.4 GHz: 243/240 Mbps

    5 GHz provides significantly higher speeds than 2.4 GHz.

Range & Coverage

    5 GHz: Shorter range but higher speed.

    2.4 GHz: Longer range but lower speed.

Interference

    5 GHz: Less interference, as it operates in a less crowded frequency.

    2.4 GHz: More interference from other devices like Bluetooth, microwaves, and older Wi-Fi devices.

IP Address Allocation

    5 GHz: Assigned 192.168.1.7

    2.4 GHz: Assigned 192.168.1.8

    Both are within the same subnet, meaning the router assigns IPs dynamically based on the connected band.

Security

    Both use WPA2-Personal encryption for security.
