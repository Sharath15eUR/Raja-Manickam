Wi-Fi networks are structured using BSS (Basic Service Set) and ESS (Extended Service Set) to manage connections between devices and access points.

BSS (Basic Service Set) - Single AP Network :

    A BSS (Basic Service Set) is the fundamental unit of a Wi-Fi network that consists of:

        One Access Point (AP)

        Multiple connected Wi-Fi devices 

        A unique BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) - The MAC address of the AP

    Types of BSS:
        1. Infrastructure BSS:

            Devices connect to an Access Point (AP).

            Used in homes, offices, and public Wi-Fi hotspots.

            Example: Your home Wi-Fi router and connected devices.

        2. Independent BSS (IBSS or Ad-hoc Network):

            Devices communicate without an AP (peer-to-peer).

            Used for temporary direct connections (e.g., file sharing).

            Example: Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth tethering.

ESS (Extended Service Set) - Multiple APs for Seamless Roaming
    An ESS (Extended Service Set) is a network of multiple BSSs connected together:

    Uses multiple APs with the same SSID (Wi-Fi network name).

    Devices can roam between APs without reconnecting.

    Used in large areas (e.g., offices, hotels, universities, airports).

    Each AP has a unique BSSID (MAC address), but the same SSID.

    Example of ESS:
    A university campus Wi-Fi with multiple access points in different buildings.
    A corporate office Wi-Fi with multiple floors covered by separate APs.
