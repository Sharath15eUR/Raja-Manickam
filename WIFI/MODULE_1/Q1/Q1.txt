Wi-Fi operates at Layer 1 (Physical Layer) and Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model:

1.Physical Layer (Layer 1): Defines the radio frequency (RF) signals, modulation, and transmission methods.
   
    Defines frequency bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz).

    Handles signal modulation (converting digital data into RF signals).

    Manages transmission power and signal strength.

    Supports multiple transmission standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax)



2.Data Link Layer (Layer 2): Handles MAC (Media Access Control) addressing, authentication, encryption, and frame transmission.
    
    MAC Sublayer in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
        Uses CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) instead of CSMA/CD (used in wired Ethernet).

        Implements ACK (Acknowledgment) mechanism to confirm data receipt.

        Supports frame retransmission in case of packet loss.

        Uses Wi-Fi MAC addresses to identify devices.

        Handles security mechanisms such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3.

    LLC Sublayer in Wi-Fi
        Defines how frames are formatted and delivered.

        Provides error detection and flow control.

        Supports protocol multiplexing (IPv4, IPv6, ARP, etc.).
