A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) is a device that allows wireless devices (like laptops, smartphones, and tablets) to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. 
It acts as a bridge between wireless devices and a wired LAN (Local Area Network).

Basic Functions of a Wi-Fi Access Point:

Wireless Signal Transmission (Wireless Portal)
•	Converts wired network signals into radio signals (RF waves).
•	Uses 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or 6 GHz frequency bands.
•	Supports various Wi-Fi standards (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax).

Connectivity
•	Acts as a bridge between wired (Ethernet) and wireless networks.
•	Allows devices like smartphones, laptops, and smart TVs to connect wirelessly.


Coverage
•	Extends Wi-Fi range within an area (home, office, campus).
•	Uses high-gain antennas to improve signal strength.
•	Multiple APs can be deployed for larger coverage (ESS networks).

Medium Access (MAC Layer Functions)
•	Handles Wi-Fi medium access using CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance).
•	Manages device connections and prioritizes traffic to reduce interference.

Security Management
Wi-Fi APs ensure network security using:
•	Encryption protocols:
    •	WEP (Weak, outdated)
    •	WPA, WPA2 (Commonly used)
    •	WPA3 (Most secure, modern standard)
•	MAC address filtering: Restricts network access to specific devices.
•	Authentication methods: Uses 802.1X authentication (RADIUS servers) for enterprise security.

DHCP Relay & IP Management
•	Can relay DHCP requests to an external DHCP server in enterprise networks.

Bandwidth Control & Quality of Service (QoS)
•	Manages bandwidth per user or device to prevent congestion.
•	Uses WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia) to prioritize voice, video, and data traffic.
•	Ensures stable network performance for streaming, gaming, and VoIP.

Mobility & Roaming Support
•	Allows seamless roaming between multiple APs in an Extended Service Set (ESS).
•	Uses fast roaming (802.11r/k/v) for smooth transitions without disconnection.

Virtual Networks (SSID & VLAN Support)
•	Supports multiple SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers) on the same AP.
•	Uses VLANs (Virtual LANs) to segment network traffic for security.
•	Example: Separate SSIDs for guests, employees, and IoT devices.
