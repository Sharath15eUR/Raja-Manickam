Both 802.11a and 802.11b are wireless communication standards developed by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) under the 802.11 family of Wi-Fi protocols. 
These standards define how wireless devices communicate over radio frequencies.

Differences Between 802.11a and 802.11b

1.Frequency

    802.11a operates on the 5 GHz band.

    802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz band.

2.Speed

    802.11a supports speeds up to 54 Mbps.

    802.11b supports speeds up to 11 Mbps.

3.Range

    802.11a has a shorter range (~50m indoors).

    802.11b has a longer range (~100m indoors).

4.Interference

    802.11a experiences less interference due to the less crowded 5 GHz band.

    802.11b is more prone to interference because 2.4 GHz is shared with many other devices.

5.Adoption

    802.11a is commonly used in business environments.

    802.11b is more popular in home networks.
