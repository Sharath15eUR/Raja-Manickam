Wi-Fi Topologies and Their Use Cases

Basic Service Set (BSS) -  Infrastructure Mode

Description:
A single access point (AP) connects multiple wireless devices to a wired network. Devices communicate through the AP rather than directly with each other.

Use Cases:
- Home Wi-Fi networks
- Office Wi-Fi setups
- Public hotspots (cafes, hotels, airports)

Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) -  Ad Hoc Mode

Description:
Devices connect directly to each other without an AP. Works like a peer-to-peer network.

Use Cases:
- Temporary file sharing between laptops or smartphones
- Emergency or disaster recovery networks
- Military or tactical field operations

Extended Service Set (ESS) -  Multi-AP Network

Description:
Multiple APs are connected through a wired backhaul to provide seamless coverage. Devices can roam between APs without losing connection.

Use Cases:
- Large offices, universities, and shopping malls
- Hotels and corporate buildings
- Public Wi-Fi networks

Mesh Wi-Fi Network

Description:
Uses multiple APs (called mesh nodes) connected wirelessly to provide extended coverage. APs communicate with each other to dynamically route traffic.

Use Cases:
- Large homes or offices with weak signal areas
- Smart cities and IoT-based networks
- Industrial and campus-wide Wi-Fi setups

Wi-Fi Repeater/Extender Network

Description:
A repeater or range extender amplifies and retransmits the signal from an existing AP. It helps improve Wi-Fi coverage in areas with weak signals.

Use Cases:
- Large homes or buildings with Wi-Fi dead zones
- Warehouses or multi-floor offices
- Temporary event venues

Wi-Fi Direct (Peer-to-Peer Mode)

Description:
Allows two devices to connect directly via Wi-Fi without an AP. Uses Wi-Fi Direct protocol to enable high-speed file transfer.

Use Cases:
- Wireless printing
- Screen mirroring (e.g., Miracast)
- File sharing between smartphones, laptops, or smart TVs

Hotspot (Tethering Mode)

Description:
A device (e.g., smartphone or portable router) shares its internet connection via Wi-Fi. Works like a mobile router.

Use Cases:
- Providing internet on the go using mobile data
- Temporary internet access for multiple devices
- Public Wi-Fi hotspots in cafes, airports, and buses
