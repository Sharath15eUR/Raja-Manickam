1. What are the pillars of Wi-Fi security?

Wireless networks (Wi-Fi) are an important part of modern communication. However, because wireless signals travel through the air, they are more vulnerable to security risks compared to wired networks.
To protect Wi-Fi networks, four major pillars of security are implemented:
Authentication, Encryption, Integrity, and Access Control.

These pillars together ensure that the Wi-Fi network remains safe from unauthorized access, data theft, and malicious activities.

1. Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of a device or user trying to access the network. Without proper authentication, anyone could join the network and misuse it.

Types of Authentication:

•Open Authentication:
No authentication is required. Anyone can connect.
Example: Public Wi-Fi in cafes or airports.

•Pre-Shared Key (PSK):
A password is shared between all users.
Example: Home networks where everyone knows the same Wi-Fi password.

•Enterprise Authentication (802.1X):
Each user has unique credentials (username and password), often verified by a RADIUS server.
Example: In an office, employees log in individually with their work credentials.

2. Encryption
Encryption ensures that the data traveling over the wireless network cannot be read or modified by outsiders. Even if someone captures the Wi-Fi traffic, encryption prevents them from understanding the data.

Types of Encryption:

•WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):
An outdated and insecure protocol.

•WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):
Improved security but still vulnerable.

•WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2):
Introduced AES encryption, providing strong protection.

•WPA3:
The latest and most secure standard, offering better protection even with weak passwords.

Example:
When shopping online using a secured Wi-Fi network (WPA2 or WPA3), your credit card information is encrypted, keeping it safe from hackers.

3. Integrity
Integrity guarantees that the information sent over the network remains unchanged during transmission.
If someone tries to alter a packet during transfer, integrity checks detect and reject the tampered data.

•Mechanisms used for integrity:

•Message Integrity Check (MIC):
Adds a signature to each message that verifies its originality.

•Cryptographic Hash Functions:
Algorithms like SHA verify that data hasn’t been modified.

Example:
When submitting an online exam, integrity ensures that your answers are received exactly as you sent them, without anyone altering them midway.

4. Access Control
Access control defines who is allowed to connect and what they are allowed to access within the network.

Types of Access Control:

•MAC Address Filtering:
Allow only devices with specific MAC addresses.

•Captive Portals:
Require users to accept terms or log in before accessing the internet (common in hotels and airports).

•Role-Based Access:
Assign different levels of access depending on the user’s role (guest, staff, admin).

Example:
In a corporate environment, employees can access sensitive files, while guests are only given access to browse the internet.
