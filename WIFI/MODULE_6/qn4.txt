Why is WEP Considered Insecure Compared to WPA2 or WPA3?

A. Introduction
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the first security protocol designed to secure wireless networks. It aimed to provide security comparable to wired networks.
However, WEP has multiple weaknesses that make it highly vulnerable to attacks. Modern protocols like WPA2 and WPA3 were introduced to fix these vulnerabilities and offer stronger protection.

B. Reasons Why WEP is Insecure
1. Weak Encryption Algorithm
WEP uses the RC4 encryption algorithm, but it is implemented poorly.
The way WEP applies RC4 makes it predictable and vulnerable to attacks.
In contrast, WPA2 and WPA3 use the AES encryption algorithm, which is much stronger and currently considered very secure.

2. Small Initialization Vector (IV)
In WEP, each packet is given a 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV) to add randomness.
However, 24 bits is too small, meaning that IV values are repeated very quickly in a busy network.
Attackers can capture packets with repeated IVs and analyze them to easily find the network key.
On the other hand, WPA2 and WPA3 use longer, more complex nonce values that do not repeat easily, making this type of attack impractical.

3. Static and Shared Keys
WEP uses a single static key for all communication. This key stays the same until the network administrator manually changes it.
If an attacker manages to capture enough packets, they can break the key and gain full access to the network.
In contrast, WPA2 and WPA3 use dynamic keys, where a unique key is generated for each user session. This process, called key management, significantly enhances security.

4. No Protection Against Replay Attacks
WEP does not have strong methods to protect against replay attacks.
Attackers can capture and resend packets to trick the network into accepting fake or duplicate packets.
WPA2 introduced Message Integrity Codes (MIC) to protect against such attacks, and WPA3 offers even stronger protections with features like Protected Management Frames (PMF).

5. Easily Cracked with Free Tools
Because of all these weaknesses, WEP can be broken very easily using free tools like Aircrack-ng.
In many cases, it takes only a few minutes for an attacker to crack a WEP network by simply capturing a few thousand packets.
WPA2 is much harder to crack if strong passwords are used, and WPA3 is designed to resist even more powerful attacks, including offline dictionary attacks.

C. How WPA2 and WPA3 Fix These Problems
Compared to WEP:

Encryption Strength: WEP uses weak RC4 encryption, while WPA2 and WPA3 use strong AES encryption.
Key Management: WEP uses a static key for all users; WPA2 and WPA3 generate dynamic session keys for each connection.
Initialization Vector Size: WEP’s 24-bit IV is very small; WPA2 and WPA3 use much longer and more secure values.
Protection Against Attacks: WEP lacks strong protection against replay and forgery attacks; WPA2 and WPA3 include strong security mechanisms to prevent such exploits.
Resistance to Cracking: WEP can be cracked easily in minutes; WPA2 and WPA3 are significantly more resistant, especially when strong passwords are used.

In short, WEP is insecure because of its poor encryption, static key use, small IV size, lack of strong integrity checks, and vulnerability to easy attacks.
Today, using WEP is considered extremely dangerous, and networks must use stronger protocols like WPA2 or preferably WPA3 to ensure proper Wi-Fi security.
WPA2 and WPA3 have addressed WEP’s weaknesses by offering robust encryption, dynamic key exchange, and protection against modern attack techniques, making them far more reliable for securing wireless networks.
