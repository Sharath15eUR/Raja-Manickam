Differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3

A. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
Definition:
WEP is the first security protocol designed to provide a level of security equivalent to a wired network.
It was introduced in 1997 as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard for Wi-Fi.

Process:
Uses a static, pre-shared key (either 40-bit or 104-bit) for both authentication and encryption.
RC4 (a stream cipher) is used to encrypt the data.
An Initialization Vector (IV) is added to the encryption to create variations, but the IV is short (24 bits) and easily predictable.

Characteristics:
• Simple and easy to implement.
• Extremely vulnerable — attackers can crack WEP keys within minutes using freely available tools.
• No protection against packet replay attacks.
• The IV is reused, leading to easy cryptographic attacks.
• Considered obsolete and insecure today.

Use Cases:
• Early home and small office Wi-Fi networks (1997–early 2000s).
• Some very old devices (legacy systems) may still only support WEP.
• Not recommended for any modern Wi-Fi networks.

B. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)
Definition:
WPA was introduced in 2003 as an immediate solution to the weaknesses of WEP.
It was developed as a temporary standard while WPA2 was being finalized.

Process:
Still uses RC4 for encryption (like WEP) but with improved key management.
Introduces TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), which dynamically changes keys for each data packet.
Introduces message integrity checks to prevent packet tampering.

Characteristics:
• Stronger than WEP but still based on an older encryption method (RC4).
• Dynamic key generation using TKIP makes it harder to crack.
• Backward compatible with older hardware that supported WEP.
• Still vulnerable to certain attacks (e.g., WPA-PSK cracking).

Use Cases:
• Transitional networks upgrading from WEP.
• Old routers and devices manufactured between 2003 and 2006.
• Better than WEP, but still not considered secure today.

C. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)
Definition:
WPA2 was introduced in 2004 as the official Wi-Fi security standard, replacing WPA.
It offers much stronger security by introducing advanced encryption techniques.

Process:
Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of RC4.
Supports two modes:
WPA2-Personal (PSK): For home networks (uses a shared password).
WPA2-Enterprise: For businesses (uses a RADIUS server for authentication).
Includes strong message integrity checks and key management.

Characteristics:
• Highly secure and reliable for most environments.
• AES encryption makes it very difficult to crack.
• Widely adopted across all modern Wi-Fi networks.
• Vulnerable only if users choose weak passwords (dictionary attacks).

Use Cases:
• Home Wi-Fi networks (using WPA2-Personal).
• Business networks with centralized authentication (WPA2-Enterprise).
• Wi-Fi Certified devices must support WPA2 since 2006.

D. WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)
Definition:
WPA3 was introduced in 2018 to address the shortcomings of WPA2 and to prepare for future wireless security threats.

Process:
Uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) instead of PSK — making password guessing much harder.
Offers forward secrecy, meaning even if an attacker gets a key later, past communications remain safe.
Uses 192-bit cryptographic strength for enterprise environments.
Improves security for open/public Wi-Fi networks using Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE).

Characteristics:
• Highly resistant to offline dictionary attacks.
• Better protection even with weaker passwords.
• Encrypted communication even in open networks (without passwords).
• Backward compatible with WPA2 devices (optional in transition modes).
• Still being adopted gradually across devices and routers.

Use Cases:
• Modern home networks seeking highest security.
• Public Wi-Fi spots like airports and cafes (safer open Wi-Fi).
• Corporate networks needing highest encryption standards.

Key Differences (in Words):

WEP was the original Wi-Fi security method but had major weaknesses and is now obsolete.
WPA improved upon WEP with TKIP but still used outdated encryption (RC4).
WPA2 replaced WPA with strong AES encryption and remains the dominant standard today.
WPA3 is the latest improvement, offering even stronger encryption, better protection against password attacks, and improved security even on public networks.

In simple terms:

WEP = Basic but broken.

WPA = Better than WEP but still not strong enough.

WPA2 = Strong and reliable for most uses.

WPA3 = Best and future-ready security standard.
