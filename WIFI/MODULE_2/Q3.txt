CAPWAP and Its Position in the OSI Model:
CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) operates primarily at:

Layer 3 (Network Layer) → because it uses IP addressing to reach Access Points (APs).

Layer 4 (Transport Layer) → because it uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for transport.

Partially Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) when encapsulating 802.11 frames in 802.3 Ethernet frames.

Above Layer 4 for management and control functions (such as AP discovery, image upgrade, and configuration).

So, CAPWAP is a Layer 3+ protocol using UDP for transport and providing control and data tunneling functionalities.

Two Tunnels in CAPWAP
CAPWAP establishes two separate logical tunnels between the Lightweight Access Point (LWAP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC):

- Control Tunnel
Purpose: Transmits management and control messages such as:

Discovery

Join requests

Configuration updates

Keepalives

Software image download

Transport Protocol: UDP port 5246

Encryption: Protected using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)

Direction: Bidirectional between AP and WLC

Encapsulation: CAPWAP over UDP over IP over Ethernet

Unicast communication

- Data Tunnel
Purpose: Carries client data traffic (802.11 frames encapsulated in CAPWAP)

For example: Web traffic, emails, voice/video, etc.

Transport Protocol: UDP port 5247

Encryption: Optional (usually not encrypted by CAPWAP itself)

Direction: Bidirectional between AP and WLC

Encapsulation: Wireless (802.11) frame encapsulated in Ethernet (802.3) using CAPWAP

Unicast communication
