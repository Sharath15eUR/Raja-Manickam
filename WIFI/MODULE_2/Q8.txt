Challenges of Deploying Autonomous APs in a Large Network (e.g., University)
1. Lack of Centralized Management
Explanation:
•	Each autonomous AP (also called a standalone AP) is managed individually.
•	No central Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) to apply global policies or monitor the network as a whole.
Impact:
•	Manual configuration and monitoring of each AP.
•	High administrative overhead for network administrators.
•	Inconsistent configurations may occur (e.g., SSID mismatches, security settings).

2. Inefficient RF Management
Explanation:
•	Autonomous APs operate independently with no coordination of radio frequency (RF) settings like:
-   Channel allocation
-   Transmit power adjustment
Impact:
•	Increased co-channel and adjacent channel interference.
•	Poor coverage planning leading to dead zones or signal overlaps.
•	Manual tuning required to maintain performance.

3. Scalability Issues
Explanation:
•	Managing more than 50 APs independently becomes impractical.
•	No support for centralized policy enforcement, load balancing, or client roaming optimizations.
Impact:
•	Difficult to expand the network without increasing administrative complexity.
•	Inefficient use of resources and degraded performance as network grows.

4. No Centralized Security and Policy Control
Explanation:
•	Security policies like 802.1X authentication, firewall rules, and user segmentation must be configured on each AP individually.
Impact:
•	Inconsistent or outdated security policies across the network.
•	Higher risk of security breaches and compliance violations.
•	Difficult to implement role-based access or dynamic VLAN assignments.

5. Roaming Challenges
Explanation:
•	Autonomous APs do not support seamless client roaming.
•	No mechanism for client context sharing or fast handoff between APs.
Impact:
•	Session drops and latency during roaming.
•	Poor user experience for real-time applications (e.g., VoIP, video calls).
•	Especially problematic in large campuses where mobility is common.

6. Limited Visibility and Troubleshooting
Explanation:
•	No centralized logging or performance monitoring.
•	Each AP must be individually accessed for logs and diagnostics.
Impact:
•	Delayed issue detection and response.
•	Network problems like congestion, interference, or rogue devices are harder to identify.
•	No single pane of glass for viewing network health.


7. Time-Consuming Firmware Management
Explanation:
•	Each AP must be manually upgraded with new firmware.
Impact:
•	Time-consuming process across dozens of APs.
•	Higher likelihood of running inconsistent firmware versions.
•	Increases vulnerability to bugs and security threats.
