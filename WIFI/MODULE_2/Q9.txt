Local Mode Behavior (Before WLC Failure)
In Local Mode, the LWAP:
•	Establishes a CAPWAP control and data tunnel with the WLC.
•	Forwards all client traffic through the WLC.
•	Relies on the WLC for:
    -	Client authentication
    -	IP address assignment (if using DHCP relay)
    -	Policy enforcement
    -	RF management
    -	Roaming coordination

What Happens When the WLC Goes Down?
1. Control Tunnel is Lost
•	The CAPWAP control tunnel between the AP and WLC is terminated.
•	AP can no longer receive configuration or management commands from the WLC.
•	The AP cannot update its configuration or serve new clients.
2. Existing Wireless Clients Are Disconnected
•	Active clients are disconnected shortly after the WLC becomes unreachable.
•	The AP stops forwarding client traffic because the CAPWAP data tunnel is also terminated.
•	There is no local switching in Local Mode — all traffic is supposed to go through the WLC.
•	Clients will lose access to the network and internet, even though the wireless signal may still be visible.
3. AP Reboots or Enters Recovery Mode (Depending on Vendor/Config)
•	Some APs enter a reboot cycle if the WLC is not reachable for a set period.
•	Others stay up but in an idle state, waiting to reconnect to the WLC.

Why This Happens
•	Local Mode APs are essentially "thin clients" — they depend on the WLC for real-time decisions and traffic processing.
•	Without the WLC:
    -	Authentication fails
    -	Data cannot be processed
    -	Client session cannot be maintained
