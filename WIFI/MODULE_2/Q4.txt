CAPWAP (Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a protocol standardized under RFC 5415 and is primarily used to enable centralized management of Wireless Access Points (APs) by a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). 
It provides both control and data tunneling functionalities between APs and WLCs.

In terms of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, CAPWAP operates at the following layers:

Layer 3 - Network Layer: CAPWAP uses IP addressing for communication between APs and WLCs. It allows APs to communicate with controllers even across Layer 3 boundaries (i.e., across different IP subnets).

Layer 4 - Transport Layer: CAPWAP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for transporting both control and data packets.

    Control messages are sent using UDP port 5246.

    Data messages are sent using UDP port 5247.

Layer 2 - Data Link Layer: CAPWAP encapsulates 802.11 (wireless) frames within 802.3 (Ethernet) frames for transmission, making it partially operate at Layer 2 when transporting client data.

Thus, CAPWAP is considered a Layer 3+ protocol because it operates above the transport layer, utilizing Layer 3 IP and Layer 4 UDP for encapsulation and transmission.

-> The Two Tunnels in CAPWAP and Their Detailed Purpose

CAPWAP establishes two separate logical tunnels between the Lightweight Access Point (LWAP) and the Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). These are:

1.Control Tunnel

Purpose:
The control tunnel is used for the transmission of all management and control messages between the AP and the WLC. 
This includes messages necessary to discover the WLC, join the controller, and receive configuration parameters. 
It is also responsible for ongoing control tasks such as monitoring AP status, pushing updates, and sending keepalive signals to maintain the tunnel.

Detailed Functions:
AP Discovery

    When an AP boots up, it sends a Discovery Request to locate the WLC using Layer 3 CAPWAP.
    WLC replies with a Discovery Response.

AP Join Process

    After discovering the WLC, the AP sends a Join Request.
    The WLC authenticates the AP and sends a Join Response.
    Secure communication is then established using DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security).

Firmware/Image Download
    If the AP needs a firmware update, the WLC pushes the image through the control tunnel.

Configuration Management

    WLC sends SSID settings, radio settings, VLAN info, security policies, etc., to the AP via the control tunnel.

Monitoring and Heartbeats (Keepalives)
    WLC sends periodic Keepalive messages and receives Echo Requests/Responses to monitor AP health and connectivity.

State Change Notifications

    APs notify WLCs about client associations/disassociations, channel changes, etc.

Security:
Control tunnel is encrypted using DTLS, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of management communications.

Traffic Type:
    Unicast
    Lightweight AP to specific WLC over UDP port 5246

2.Data Tunnel

Purpose:
The data tunnel is used for carrying client traffic from the Access Point to the Wireless LAN Controller. 
This includes the actual data packets transmitted by end devices (such as laptops or phones) connected to the AP. 
The AP encapsulates 802.11 wireless frames into CAPWAP data frames and sends them to the WLC, which de-encapsulates them and forwards them to the wired network.

Examples of Data Messages:

Client Traffic Encapsulation

    AP captures wireless frames from clients (STA) and encapsulates them using CAPWAP.
    This ensures uniform delivery regardless of physical topology.

Centralized Data Processing

    All user data is sent to the WLC for centralized switching, routing, firewall filtering, or applying QoS policies.

Roaming Support

    When clients roam between APs, the WLC ensures seamless session continuity since itâ€™s the central point of control.

Traffic Segregation

    WLC can direct traffic from different SSIDs to different VLANs using data tunnel encapsulation.

Support for Mobility

    Since the WLC handles all client traffic, client mobility (Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming) is smooth and transparent.

Security:
    Data tunnel may or may not be encrypted (depends on implementation and settings).
    However, sensitive data is usually already protected at higher layers (e.g., HTTPS, VPN).
