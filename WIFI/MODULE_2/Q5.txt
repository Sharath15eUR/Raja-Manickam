The CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) protocol uses two logical tunnels between a Lightweight Access Point (LWAP) and a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC): a Control Tunnel and a Data Tunnel.
 Once these tunnels are established, they must be maintained to ensure continuous connectivity, control, and data flow between the AP and the controller.

1. Initial Tunnel Establishment
Before tunnel maintenance can occur, the tunnels must be established through the following steps:
•	DHCP Phase: The AP obtains an IP address using DHCP.
•	WLC Discovery Phase: The AP discovers the controller through various methods such as broadcast, DNS, or preconfigured IP.
•	Join Phase: The AP sends a Join Request and receives a Join Response.
•	CAPWAP Tunnel Establishment:
    -  Control Tunnel (UDP Port 5246): For management and control communication.
    -  Data Tunnel (UDP Port 5247): For forwarding client data traffic.
After successful authentication and provisioning, these tunnels are created.

2. Tunnel Maintenance Mechanisms
Once established, the CAPWAP tunnel between the AP and WLC is actively maintained using the following mechanisms:

A. Keepalive Messages
•	The WLC periodically sends Keepalive messages to the AP over the control tunnel.
•	The AP responds with an acknowledgment.
•	This ensures both devices are reachable and functioning properly.
Purpose:
Detects any loss of connectivity and ensures that the tunnel is alive.
Interval:
Keepalives are typically sent every 30 seconds (default; configurable).

B. Echo Request and Response (Control Channel Echo)
•	Echo Request messages are also exchanged over the control tunnel.
•	These are used for validating the connection and checking for latency or packet loss.
•	If an Echo Response is not received within a timeout period, the WLC assumes the AP is unreachable.
Purpose:
Provides a low-overhead mechanism for continuous link checking.

C. Retransmission and Timeouts
•	If control messages (like Join Request, Config Update, Keepalives) are not acknowledged within a specified timeout, the message is retransmitted.
•	After several failed retransmissions, the WLC considers the AP as “unreachable” and may tear down the tunnel.

D. DTLS Session Maintenance (for Control Tunnel Security)
•	When DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) is used for the control tunnel, the session must be maintained with proper session keys and handshakes.
•	If the DTLS session expires or is corrupted, it must be renegotiated to maintain a secure tunnel.

E. Monitoring AP Health and State
•	The WLC constantly monitors AP health via periodic status updates.
•	APs report metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, client count, and signal quality.
•	Based on this, the WLC decides whether to retain or reset the tunnel.

F. Graceful Recovery and Rejoin
•	If an AP temporarily loses connectivity, it will attempt to rejoin the WLC and re-establish the tunnels.
•	APs store configuration to minimize downtime when reconnecting.

3. Failures and Tunnel Teardown
If the CAPWAP tunnel fails due to any of the following:
•	No response to keepalives or echo requests
•	Network disconnection
•	DTLS session timeout or failure
•	Configuration inconsistency or software crash
Then:
•	The WLC will tear down the tunnel.
•	The AP will revert to the discovery and join phase.
•	A new CAPWAP session will be created once the controller becomes reachable again.
