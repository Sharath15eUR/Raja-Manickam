CAPWAP Protocol - Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points
1. What is CAPWAP?
CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) is a Layer 3 protocol defined in RFC 5415. 
It enables centralized management of Lightweight Access Points (LWAPs) through a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). 
CAPWAP abstracts the control and configuration logic from APs, allowing them to focus on wireless client connectivity while the WLC handles policy, configuration, updates, and security.

Key Objectives:
    Simplify wireless network deployment and management

    Enable centralized configuration and monitoring

    Ensure secure control communication using DTLS

    Separate control and data planes for better scalability

2. CAPWAP Communication Flow - Detailed Steps
Step 1: IP Address Allocation for AP
    Communication: Between AP and DHCP Server

    When powered on, the AP does not have an IP address.

    The AP sends a DHCP Discover broadcast.

    The DHCP server replies with a DHCP Offer.

    The AP sends a DHCP Request.

    The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK).

    Outcome: The AP obtains a valid IP address.

Step 2: WLC Discovery (AC Discovery)
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    The AP sends a Discovery Request (broadcast or unicast depending on configuration).

    The WLC replies with a Discovery Response, containing its identity and capabilities.

    If multiple WLCs respond, the AP selects the optimal one based on configured logic.

    After discovery, the AP initiates a secure handshake.

Step 3: DTLS Handshake
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    AP and WLC establish a DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) tunnel over UDP port 5246.

    DTLS ensures:

    Authentication (verifies the AP identity)

    Confidentiality (encrypts control messages)

    Integrity (ensures messages are not tampered with)

    This tunnel secures all subsequent control messages.

Step 4: Join Process
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    AP sends a Join Request to the selected WLC.

    The WLC authenticates the AP using MAC address, credentials, or digital certificates.

    If required, the WLC sends firmware image data to the AP to ensure version consistency.

    WLC replies with a Join Response, completing the registration.

Step 5: Configuration Delivery
    Communication: WLC to AP

    The WLC sends complete configuration data, including:

    SSIDs and WLAN profiles

    Security settings (e.g., WPA2, 802.1X, MAC filtering)

    Radio Frequency (RF) parameters (channel, power levels)

    VLAN mappings and Quality of Service (QoS) policies

    AP sends a Configuration Status Request, and WLC responds with a Configuration Status Response confirming the applied settings.

Step 6: Change State to Operational (RUN State)
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    AP sends a Change State Event Request to transition to operational mode.

    WLC responds with a Change State Event Response.

    AP enters the RUN state, becoming fully operational and ready to serve wireless clients.

Step 7: CAPWAP Data Tunnel Establishment
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    A separate CAPWAP data tunnel is created over UDP port 5247.

    This tunnel encapsulates and transports 802.11 data frames (wireless client traffic) between AP and WLC.

    Control and data tunnels are kept logically separate to enhance performance and security.

Step 8: Tunnel Maintenance
    Communication: Ongoing between AP and WLC

    The WLC and AP exchange periodic Keepalive and Echo Request/Response messages.

    These ensure that the CAPWAP tunnels are active and detect communication failures quickly.

    In case of failure, reconnection or fallback procedures are initiated.

Step 9: Configuration Updates
    Communication: Between AP and WLC

    If there are any changes in policies, security settings, or other configurations:

    The WLC sends a Configuration Update Request.

    The AP applies the changes and responds with a Configuration Update Response.

    This supports dynamic and remote provisioning of APs.

3. Summary
CAPWAP is a robust and scalable protocol that centralizes the control of wireless networks. 
By separating control and data planes and securing communication using DTLS, CAPWAP ensures efficient, flexible, and secure management of Access Points. 
It streamlines operations by allowing Lightweight APs to be dynamically provisioned, updated, and monitored from a central controller without manual configuration.
