What is SplitMAC Architecture?

SplitMAC stands for Split Media Access Control architecture.
It is a networking model used in wireless LAN (Local Area Network) deployments where the functionalities of the MAC layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model are divided between:

    The Access Point (AP)

    The Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)

This model is primarily seen in Lightweight Access Point (LWAP) deployments managed by controllers.

The MAC layer is typically split into two parts:

    Lower MAC (at the AP):
        These are time-critical and real-time functions that need to be handled immediately by the AP:

            Beacon Generation - Signals the presence of the AP to clients

            Acknowledgements (ACKs) - Quick responses to received data frames

            RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) - Avoids collisions

            MAC-layer Retransmissions - Ensures delivery of frames

            Client Probing - Detects nearby clients

    Upper MAC (at the WLC):
        These are control-plane and management functions handled centrally by the controller:

            Authentication and Association Handling - Validates client credentials

            Roaming Decisions - Maintains session continuity while moving between APs

            QoS (Quality of Service) Decisions - Ensures priority handling of voice/video traffic

            Security Policy Enforcement - Applies access control and encryption policies

            Load Balancing and RF (Radio Frequency) Management - Distributes client load and controls signal strength

How It Improves AP Performance:
    Centralized Management:

        Reduces the complexity of APs by offloading processing to the controller.
        Easier to manage large deployments with centralized configurations and updates.

    Efficient Resource Usage:

        APs focus on time-sensitive tasks like packet forwarding.
        The controller handles policy enforcement and higher-layer decisions.

    Enhanced Roaming Support:

        Seamless roaming as decisions are handled by the centralized WLC.
        Better experience for mobile users.

    Improved Scalability:

        Adding more APs is easier since the intelligence resides in the WLC.
        Ideal for enterprise environments.

    Security Enhancements:

        Centralized authentication and encryption policies.
        Rogue AP detection and mitigation becomes more efficient.
