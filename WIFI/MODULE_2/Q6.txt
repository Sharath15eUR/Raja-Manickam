1. Sniffer Mode
Definition:
In Sniffer Mode, the Access Point (AP) functions like a wireless packet capture device. It captures 802.11 wireless frames over the air and forwards the raw packet data to a remote analyzer tool (like Wireshark) for in-depth analysis.
Purpose:
Used for troubleshooting, protocol analysis, and detailed examination of wireless traffic at the MAC layer.
Operation:
•	The AP captures all wireless frames on a specific channel.
•	It encapsulates the raw 802.11 frames in a Remote Packet Capture (RPCAP) format.
•	These frames are forwarded to a PC running Wireshark or another analyzer tool.
•	The AP does not serve clients or participate in WLAN operations while in sniffer mode.
Use Case:
•	Deep packet inspection
•	Debugging authentication and association failures
•	Analyzing wireless protocol behavior
•	Identifying interference, retransmissions, or rogue devices
Example:
A network engineer suspects a security handshake issue during 802.1X authentication. They configure an AP in sniffer mode on the same channel and use Wireshark to capture and analyze the EAP packets.

2. Monitor Mode
Definition:
In Monitor Mode, the Access Point scans all channels to detect wireless security threats, rogue APs, and other wireless devices. It operates passively, without serving any clients.
Purpose:
Used for wireless intrusion detection, spectrum analysis, rogue AP detection, and RF monitoring.
Operation:
•	The AP constantly listens on all available channels (channel scanning).
•	It reports:
    -  Rogue APs
    -  Unauthorized clients
    -  RF interference sources
    -  Signal strength levels
•	The data is sent to the WLC or Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) for centralized analysis.
Use Case:
•	Wireless intrusion prevention
•	Identifying unauthorized access points (rogue APs)
•	Monitoring channel utilization and interference
•	Performing RF coverage surveys
Example:
A hospital Wi-Fi admin wants to ensure no unauthorized APs are active. Several LWAPs are configured in monitor mode to detect and alert the WLC of any unregistered APs broadcasting nearby.
