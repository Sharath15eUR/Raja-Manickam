Both OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) are digital modulation techniques used in Wi-Fi,
 especially in the PHY layer of modern standards. While they are related, they serve different purposes.

OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
    Used in: 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax.
    How it works: OFDM splits the data into many smaller sub-carriers (narrow frequency bands), each carrying a portion of the data in parallel.
    Each transmission is assigned the full channel for a short period.
    It improves data rates and resistance to interference caused by multipath fading.

    - Analogy: Like sending a large group message by splitting it into many small messages and sending them quickly one after another using the entire road.

OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
    Used in: 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) and 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7).
    How it works: OFDMA builds on OFDM by allowing multiple users to share the same channel at the same time by dividing the subcarriers among them.
    The channel is split into Resource Units (RUs) - each user gets a portion of subcarriers in the same time slot.
    This allows simultaneous communication with multiple devices, improving efficiency and reducing latency.

    - Analogy: Like dividing a highway into multiple lanes and letting many cars (users) travel side by side at once.
