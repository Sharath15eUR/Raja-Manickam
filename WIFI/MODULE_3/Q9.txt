MIMO and MU-MIMO are technologies used in Wi-Fi (starting from 802.11n and enhanced in 802.11ac/ax) to improve speed, reliability, and
 network efficiency using multiple antennas. 

MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
    Introduced in: IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
    How it works: Uses multiple transmitting and receiving antennas to send multiple data streams between a single transmitter and a single receiver.
    Improves:

        Throughput: By sending more data in parallel.
        Reliability: Through spatial diversity (better signal in complex environments).
        Only one device communicates with the router at a time, even if multiple antennas are used.

    Analogy: Like sending multiple packages (data streams) from one sender to one receiver using multiple delivery trucks (antennas).

MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO)
    Introduced in: IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5 – downlink only), enhanced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 – uplink and downlink).
    How it works: Allows the router to simultaneously communicate with multiple devices by assigning separate spatial streams to each.
    Improves:

        Efficiency in busy environments with many connected devices.
        Network capacity and reduced waiting time for users.
        Supports multiple users at the same time, each with their own data stream.

    -  Analogy: Like sending different packages to different houses at the same time using separate trucks — rather than sending them one by one.
