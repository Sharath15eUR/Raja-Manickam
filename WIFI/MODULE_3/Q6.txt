A Guard Interval (GI) is a small time gap inserted between data symbols during wireless transmission. 
Its main role is to prevent interference between symbols caused by delayed signal reflections, 
a phenomenon known as multipath interference.

In environments like indoor spaces, Wi-Fi signals can bounce off walls or objects.
 These reflected signals may arrive at the receiver slightly later than the original signal. 
 Without a guard interval, these delayed versions can interfere with the next symbol, causing errors.

To avoid this, Wi-Fi standards use a guard interval â€” giving enough time for these echoes to settle before the next symbol begins.

Short Guard Interval (SGI) and Its Benefit
    A Short Guard Interval (usually 400 nanoseconds) allows more data symbols to be transmitted in the same amount of time, which improves overall efficiency and throughput.
    It is used in standards like 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax.
    Compared to the standard 800 ns guard interval, SGI can improve data rates by about 10%.

When Is Short GI Useful?
    In environments with low interference or short distances, SGI performs well and increases speed.
    In echo-heavy or reflective environments, the longer guard interval may be more stable and reliable.
