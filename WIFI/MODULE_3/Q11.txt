What is PPDU?
A PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit) is the complete frame that is transmitted over the air by the PHY layer in Wi-Fi. 
It contains everything needed by the receiver to detect, decode, and process the transmission, including synchronization, control info, and the payload.

Different Wi-Fi standards (generations) define different types of PPDUs, based on their capabilities like MIMO, OFDMA, MU-MIMO, channel width, and more.

Types of PPDU and Their Frame Formats
Each Wi-Fi generation (e.g., 802.11a/n/ac/ax) defines its own PPDU format, mainly differing in the preamble and header fields. Here are the major types:

1. Legacy PPDU (Used in 802.11a/g)
    This is the simplest format.

    Structure:

    Preamble: Includes Short and Long Training Fields (STF, LTF) to allow synchronization and channel estimation.

    Signal Field: Tells the receiver how the payload is encoded (modulation, data rate, length).

    Payload (Data): The actual data transmitted.

    - No support for MIMO or advanced features.

2. HT PPDU (High Throughput – 802.11n)
    Introduced MIMO and channel bonding (20/40 MHz).

    Supports optional Short Guard Interval and frame aggregation.

    Structure:

    Legacy fields (for backward compatibility).

    HT-SIG (HT Signal field): Describes MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme), length, etc.

    HT-STF, HT-LTF: For MIMO support and spatial streams.

    Payload: MAC data.

    - Enables faster speeds and more reliable connections.

3. VHT PPDU (Very High Throughput – 802.11ac)
    Supports wider channels (up to 160 MHz) and multi-user MIMO (downlink only).

    Higher modulation (up to 256-QAM).

    Structure:

    VHT-SIG-A and VHT-SIG-B: Provide info about number of users, streams, channel width, MCS.

    VHT-STF and multiple VHT-LTFs: For advanced MIMO performance.

    Payload: Data to be sent to one or multiple users.

    - Delivers gigabit speeds and improved downlink performance.

4. HE PPDU (High Efficiency – 802.11ax / Wi-Fi 6)
    Introduces OFDMA, MU-MIMO (uplink and downlink), BSS Coloring, and Target Wake Time.

    Designed for dense environments like campuses, stadiums, etc.

    Multiple formats:

    HE SU PPDU: For single-user transmission.

    HE MU PPDU: For multi-user downlink.

    HE TB PPDU: Trigger-based uplink multi-user.

    HE ER SU PPDU: Extended range (for long-distance use cases).

    Structure:

    HE-SIG fields to define resource units (RUs), user allocation, MCS.

    HE-STF, HE-LTF for advanced synchronization and channel estimation.

    Data payload.

    - Increases efficiency and reduces latency in crowded networks.

5. EHT PPDU (Extremely High Throughput – 802.11be / Wi-Fi 7)
    Supports 320 MHz channels, 4096-QAM, and Multi-Link Operation.

    Can send parallel transmissions across multiple frequency bands.

    PPDU types include:

    EHT SU PPDU

    EHT MU PPDU

    EHT TB PPDU

    EHT MLO PPDU (Multi-Link Operation)

    - Provides ultra-high speeds and very low latency.
