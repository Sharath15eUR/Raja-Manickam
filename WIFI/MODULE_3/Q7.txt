The 802.11 PHY (Physical Layer) frame, also called a Physical Protocol Data Unit (PPDU), is the format used to transmit data over the air in Wi-Fi.
 It is constructed at the physical layer and contains all the necessary components to synchronize, decode, and transmit data between wireless devices.

Although the structure can vary slightly between standards (e.g., 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax), all PHY layer frames include the following core components:

Key Components of a PHY Layer Frame (PPDU)
Preamble:

    This is the first part of the frame.
    It allows the receiver to detect the signal, synchronize with it, and perform channel estimation.
    It includes:

        Short Training Field (STF) – used for signal detection and automatic gain control.

        Long Training Field (LTF) – used for channel estimation and timing synchronization.

        Signal Field – carries information about the modulation, coding rate, and length of the payload.

Header (PLCP Header):

    PLCP = Physical Layer Convergence Protocol.
    This tells the receiver how to interpret the payload.
    It includes:

        Rate, length, modulation type, and coding scheme.

        Sometimes includes service bits and CRC.

Payload/Data Field:

    This is the actual user data passed down from the MAC layer.
    It includes:

        MAC frame + possible padding and tail bits for encoding.

        Modulated using the modulation scheme defined in the signal field (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, QAM).


Variations by Standard:
802.11a/g: Fixed preamble and header format.

802.11n: Supports HT (High Throughput) format with more LTFs for MIMO.

802.11ac: Adds VHT (Very High Throughput) fields for MU-MIMO and wider channels.

802.11ax: Includes HE (High Efficiency) preamble with support for OFDMA, BSS coloring, and uplink scheduling.
