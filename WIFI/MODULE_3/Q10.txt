In the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi architecture, the PHY (Physical) layer is divided into two key sublayers, and it uses specific formats for transmitting data. Three important terms used in this context are PPDU, PLCP, and PMD.

1. PPDU – Physical Protocol Data Unit
The PPDU is the entire frame that the physical layer sends over the air.

It includes all parts necessary for synchronization, control, and actual data transmission.

A PPDU consists of:

    Preamble

    PLCP Header

    PHY Payload (data from MAC layer)

-  Think of the PPDU as the final "package" that is transmitted wirelessly.

2. PLCP – Physical Layer Convergence Protocol
The PLCP is a sublayer of the PHY.

It receives the MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) and adds necessary information (like headers and preamble) to help the receiver process the frame.

Responsibilities:

Adds a PLCP header for rate, length, modulation type, etc.

Ensures synchronization and compatibility with various physical media.

-  It acts like a translator between the MAC layer and the physical radio hardware.

3. PMD – Physical Medium Dependent Sublayer
The PMD is the lowest sublayer of the PHY.

It is responsible for the actual transmission and reception of signals through the physical medium (air).

Key functions:

Modulation and demodulation of the radio signal.

Handling RF characteristics (frequency, power).

Interfacing with antennas and RF circuitry.

-  This is the layer that interacts directly with the wireless environment.
