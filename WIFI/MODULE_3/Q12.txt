In Wi-Fi networks, the data rate (physical layer rate) refers to the speed at which bits are transmitted over the air. 
It is influenced by several physical layer parameters defined by the IEEE 802.11 standard.

Wi-Fi Data Rate Formula:

    Data Rate = (N_SD * N_BPSCS * R * N_SS) / (T_DFT + T_GI)

Where:
- N_SD      = Number of data subcarriers (e.g., 52 for a 20 MHz channel)
- N_BPSCS   = Number of coded bits per subcarrier per stream (depends on modulation type)
- R         = Coding rate (e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6)
- N_SS      = Number of spatial streams (used in MIMO)
- T_DFT     = OFDM symbol duration (e.g., 3.2 µs)
- T_GI      = Guard interval duration (e.g., 0.8 µs or 0.4 µs for short GI)

Explanation:

- Modulation Scheme (N_BPSCS): Higher-order modulations like QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, or 256-QAM can carry more bits per subcarrier.
- Coding Rate (R): Determines the amount of redundancy. Higher rates provide more efficiency but less error correction.
- Spatial Streams (N_SS): Using multiple streams in MIMO systems increases total throughput.
- Guard Interval (T_GI): A short guard interval (e.g., 0.4 µs) reduces symbol spacing, improving throughput.
- Wider Channels: Allow for more subcarriers (N_SD), increasing the data rate.

This formula allows to calculate the theoretical maximum throughput for different configurations in 802.11 standards (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax).
