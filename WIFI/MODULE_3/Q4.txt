Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

OFDM is a digital multi-carrier modulation technique used in wireless communications, including Wi-Fi (starting from IEEE 802.11a). 
Instead of transmitting data over a single high-rate carrier, OFDM splits the signal into multiple smaller sub-signals (subcarriers) 
 that are transmitted simultaneously over different frequencies, which are mathematically orthogonal to each other.

OFDM significance in WLAN

Improved Spectral Efficiency:

    OFDM allows many subcarriers to overlap without interference due to orthogonality.
    This increases the data rate while maintaining efficient use of available bandwidth.

Resistance to Multipath Interference:

    Wireless signals often reflect off surfaces, causing delayed copies of the signal (multipath).
    OFDM handles multipath very well because each subcarrier operates at a lower data rate and with longer symbol duration, 
    making it less vulnerable to delay spread.

Higher Data Rates:

    With the ability to use higher-order modulation (like 64-QAM or 256-QAM) on each subcarrier, OFDM supports faster transmission of data.

Scalability Across Standards:

    OFDM is used in 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax (Wi-Fi 5 and 6).
    In 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), OFDM evolves into OFDMA, which further improves performance by supporting multi-user access.

Efficient Error Handling:

    OFDM works well with Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques like convolutional coding and LDPC, which enhance reliability without sacrificing too much throughput.

How OFDM Improves WLAN Performance:

Performance Factor	                                          OFDM Advantage

Interference Handling	                    Orthogonal subcarriers reduce inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference
Multipath Resilience	                    Long symbol durations and cyclic prefix reduce issues caused by reflected signals
High Throughput                         	Supports high data rates with parallel transmission of many subcarriers
Scalability	                                Easy to adapt bandwidth and subcarrier spacing for different environments
Flexibility in Modulation	                Each subcarrier can use a different modulation scheme (BPSK to 1024-QAM)
