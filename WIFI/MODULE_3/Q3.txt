 
Question 3: How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer? Compare different modulation schemes and their performance across various Wi-Fi standards.

Modulation schemes in the Physical (PHY) layer are techniques used to encode digital data (binary bits) onto radio frequency (RF) signals for wireless transmission. These techniques work by altering properties of the carrier wave, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase, to represent data. The key goal is to efficiently transmit data over the air while maintaining reliability and maximizing throughput.

Main Modulation Techniques Used in Wi-Fi:

1. BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)
- Modulates data by shifting the phase of the carrier wave between two states.
- Carries 1 bit per symbol.
- Very robust in noisy environments.
- Used in 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax standards.

2. QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)
- Modulates data using four distinct phase shifts.
- Carries 2 bits per symbol.
- Offers a balance between data rate and robustness.

3. QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
- Combines amplitude and phase modulation.
- Higher-order versions (16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, 1024-QAM, 4096-QAM) transmit more bits per symbol.
- Used in 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax/be, where higher modulation levels provide higher data rates but require cleaner signal conditions (higher SNR).

4. DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum)
- Spreads the signal over a wide frequency band using a chipping code.
- Makes the signal more resistant to narrowband interference.
- Used in 802.11b.

5. FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum)
- Rapidly switches (hops) carrier frequencies in a sequence.
- Reduces interference and enhances security.
- Used in early wireless systems, including Bluetooth and some 802.11 legacy modes.

6. OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Divides the channel into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, each modulated separately.
- Increases data rate and reduces inter-symbol interference.
- Used in 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax standards.

7. OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
- An enhancement of OFDM allowing multiple users to transmit simultaneously over different subcarriers.
- Greatly improves spectrum efficiency and latency.
- Introduced in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) and continued in Wi-Fi 7.

Performance:
Higher modulation = more bits per symbol = higher throughput.

But higher modulation also requires better Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and less interference.

Wi-Fi adapts modulation dynamically using rate adaptation algorithms, based on channel conditions (e.g., distance, interference).
