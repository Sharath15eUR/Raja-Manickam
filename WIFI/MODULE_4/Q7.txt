Power saving is essential in wireless networks, especially for battery-operated devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, IoT devices, etc.
The MAC (Medium Access Control) layer of IEEE 802.11 includes mechanisms to reduce power consumption without significantly affecting communication performance.

Objective of MAC Layer Power Saving
The aim is to:
•	Let the device sleep (enter low-power mode) when it has nothing to send or receive.
•	Wake up periodically to check if there is any data buffered at the Access Point (AP).
•	Receive the buffered data when available, and then go back to sleep.
This saves battery life while maintaining connectivity and performance.

Basic Power Saving Mechanism in IEEE 802.11 (Legacy Power Save Mode)
1. PS (Power Save) Bit
Each wireless client (STA – station) maintains a Power Save (PS) mode flag in its MAC frame header.
•	PS bit = 0 → Station is in Active mode (always listening).
•	PS bit = 1 → Station is in Power Save mode (goes to sleep).
The AP keeps track of the station’s power mode.

2. Beacon Frames and TIM
•	The AP periodically sends Beacon frames (every 100 ms typically).
•	Beacon includes a Traffic Indication Map (TIM).
•	TIM is a bitmap indicating which stations have data buffered at the AP.
The client wakes up at every Beacon interval, checks the TIM.
If its bit is set, it stays awake to receive the data.
Otherwise, it goes back to sleep.

3. PS-Poll Frames
•	If the TIM shows buffered data for a client, the client sends a PS-Poll frame to the AP.
•	The AP responds with the data frame or a sequence of data frames.
•	After receiving all the data, the client goes back to sleep.

Types of Power Saving Mechanisms
IEEE 802.11 has evolved to include more efficient power-saving schemes in addition to the legacy PS mechanism:

1. Legacy Power Save Mode (802.11 standard)
•	The oldest and most basic method.
•	Uses TIM and PS-Poll to manage sleep and wake cycles.
•	Works well but can be inefficient in high-latency networks or for high-throughput devices.

2. Automatic Power Save Delivery (APSD) – 802.11e
There are two types under APSD:
a) U-APSD (Unscheduled APSD)
•	Used in Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM).
•	Instead of polling using PS-Poll frames, the station sends a trigger frame (like a QoS data packet).
•	The AP then delivers multiple queued frames.
Advantage: Reduces frame exchanges, thus more efficient.
b) S-APSD (Scheduled APSD)
•	Used when traffic is periodic (e.g., VoIP).
•	The client and AP agree on a fixed schedule for data transmission.
•	The client wakes up only at scheduled times.
Advantage: Very efficient for real-time applications.

3. Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP) – 802.11n
•	Introduced to improve power efficiency in high-throughput networks.
•	Uses PSMP frames that define precise sleep/wake schedules.
•	Reduces the overhead of individual PS-Poll or trigger frames.
Advantage: More power-efficient for multiple stations.

4. Target Wake Time (TWT) – 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
•	Advanced and most efficient power-saving method.
•	The AP and station negotiate specific wake-up times.
•	The client wakes up only at the agreed-upon time, communicates, and then sleeps.
Use case: Perfect for IoT and battery-powered sensors that don’t need constant communication.
Benefits:
•	Reduces channel contention.
•	Optimizes power consumption.
•	Improves battery life.
