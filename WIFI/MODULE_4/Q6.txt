The client association process is the step-by-step procedure by which a wireless client (like a smartphone, laptop, or IoT device) connects to a Wi-Fi network via an Access Point (AP). 
It is part of the MAC layer management functionality and involves multiple stages to establish a secure, authenticated, and synchronized connection.
Step 1: Access Point sends ANonce to Client
•	The AP (router) starts the handshake by generating a random number called ANonce (Authenticator Nonce).
•	It sends this ANonce to the client.
Why?
•	This ANonce will be used later by both the AP and client to generate the same encryption key (PTK).
•	Sending this early ensures both sides use the same random value for key generation.
It’s like the AP is saying:
"Here’s a random number. We’ll both use it to create the same secret code."

Step 2: Client sends SNonce and MIC to Access Point
•	Now, the client:
o	Creates its own random number, called SNonce (Supplicant Nonce).
o	Uses: PMK + ANonce + SNonce + MAC addresses to generate the PTK (a unique session key).
•	Then the client sends:
o	The SNonce to the AP.
o	A special security tag called MIC (Message Integrity Code) to prove that it used the right key.
Why?
•	The AP now knows the SNonce.
•	Since both sides have:
o	PMK
o	ANonce
o	SNonce
o	MAC addresses
...they can now independently compute the same PTK.
It’s like the client is saying:
"Here’s my part of the random code. I’ve already calculated our final secret key (PTK). Check this MIC to confirm I did it right."

Step 3: Access Point sends GTK and MIC to Client
•	The AP now calculates its own PTK using all the known inputs.
•	It checks the MIC received from the client to make sure the PTK matches.
•	Then, the AP:
o	Encrypts the GTK (Group Temporal Key) using part of the PTK.
o	Sends it to the client, along with a new MIC.
Why?
•	GTK is the key used for broadcast/multicast messages that all clients must know.
•	This step securely gives the GTK to the client without exposing it.
It’s like the AP is saying:
"We now share the same PTK. Here’s a secure copy of the group key (GTK), encrypted using our PTK."

Step 4: Client sends final confirmation to Access Point
•	The client installs the PTK and GTK.
•	It sends a final confirmation message with a MIC to the AP.
Why?
•	This confirms that the client has received and installed all keys correctly.
•	Once this is done, encrypted data communication begins.
It’s like the client is saying:
"I got the group key (GTK), and I’m ready to send encrypted data now."

PMK (Pairwise Master Key): Derived from the Pre-Shared Key (in WPA2-Personal) or from the authentication server (in WPA2-Enterprise).

PTK (Pairwise Transient Key): Session-specific key used for data encryption between client and AP.

GTK (Group Temporal Key): Used to encrypt broadcast and multicast traffic.

Nonce: A random number used once per session to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.

    ANonce: AP’s nonce.

    SNonce: Supplicant's nonce.

MIC (Message Integrity Code): Used to ensure the integrity of handshake messages.
