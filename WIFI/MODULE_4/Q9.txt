In traditional ACK (Acknowledgment), each transmitted frame must be individually acknowledged. This results in a lot of overhead, especially when sending multiple data frames consecutively.
The Block ACK mechanism allows the receiver to acknowledge multiple data frames in a single acknowledgment frame, reducing protocol overhead and improving throughput.
Block ACK Working
1. Setup: Block ACK Agreement
•	Before using Block ACK, the sender and receiver must agree to use it.
•	This is done through a Block ACK Request/Response negotiation.
2. Data Transmission (Burst of Frames)
•	The sender transmits multiple data frames in sequence (called an A-MPDU – Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit).
•	These can be part of the same Traffic Identifier (TID) (e.g., same QoS category).
3. Receiver Stores Frames
•	The receiver receives the frames and buffers them temporarily.
•	It keeps track of which frames were received correctly and which were missing or corrupted.
4. Block ACK Request
•	The sender then sends a Block ACK Request (BAR) to the receiver, asking for an acknowledgment of all previously sent frames.
5. Block ACK Response
•	The receiver replies with a Block ACK, which includes:
	-	A bitmap indicating which frames were received successfully.
	-	The starting sequence number of the block.
	-	This lets the sender know which frames need to be retransmitted.

Types of Block ACK
1. Immediate Block ACK
•	The Block ACK is sent immediately after receiving the Block ACK Request.
2. Delayed Block ACK
•	The receiver waits for a short time before sending the Block ACK.
•	Useful in power-saving or congested environments.

Structure of Block ACK Frame (Simplified)
A Block ACK frame contains:
•	Receiver address
•	TID
•	Starting sequence number
•	Bitmap (64 bits) indicating success/failure of up to 64 frames

Advantages of Block ACK
1. Higher Throughput
•	Reduces the number of ACK frames.
•	More time is used for actual data transmission.
2. Lower Overhead
•	Fewer control frames are sent.
•	Frame aggregation (A-MPDU) becomes more efficient.
3. Efficient Retransmission
•	Sender only retransmits the specific frames indicated as missing in the bitmap.
•	No need to resend the entire burst.
4. Essential for High-Speed Standards
•	Used heavily in 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax to support high data rates.
•	Enables frame aggregation, which is a key performance enhancement in modern Wi-Fi.

Use Case Example
•	A Wi-Fi device sends 20 frames back-to-back.
•	Instead of waiting for 20 individual ACKs, it sends a Block ACK Request.
•	The receiver replies with a Block ACK indicating that, for example, frames 3 and 7 were lost.
•	The sender retransmits only those two frames, saving time and bandwidth.
