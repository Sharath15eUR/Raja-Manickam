Main MAC Access Methodologies in IEEE 802.11
1. DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)
DCF is the default MAC mechanism in IEEE 802.11. It is based on:
CSMA/CA – Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance.
How it works:
1.	Carrier Sensing:
	-	Device first listens to the channel (called Clear Channel Assessment or CCA).
	-	If the channel is idle for a Distributed Interframe Space (DIFS) duration, it proceeds to transmit.
2.	Backoff Mechanism:
	-	If the channel is busy, the device waits until it's free.
	-	Then it waits a random backoff time (selected from a Contention Window) before retrying.
3.	Collision Avoidance:
	-	Since it can’t detect collisions during transmission, it avoids them using random delays.
	-	Uses ACK (Acknowledgment) frames to confirm successful transmission.
4.	Optional RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send):
	-	Used to avoid hidden node problems.
	-	RTS/CTS exchanges reserve the channel before data is sent.
Key Features:
•	Decentralized
•	Suitable for ad-hoc or infrastructure networks
•	Used in both data and management frames

2. PCF (Point Coordination Function)
PCF is an optional, centralized MAC mechanism, defined in the original IEEE 802.11 standard.
It uses a central coordinator (usually the AP) to control when devices transmit.
How it works:
•	The AP acts as the Point Coordinator.
•	It defines a Contention-Free Period (CFP) where it polls each station and grants it permission to send.
•	This avoids collisions but is rarely implemented in practice.
Key Features:
•	Enables contention-free service.
•	Supports real-time or delay-sensitive traffic (e.g., voice/video).
•	Not commonly used in modern Wi-Fi due to complexity.

3. Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) – from 802.11e
HCF combines the benefits of DCF and PCF. It was introduced in the 802.11e amendment for Quality of Service (QoS).
HCF includes:
a) EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access)
•	Extension of DCF.
•	Adds traffic categories (TCs) with different priorities (e.g., voice, video, best effort).
•	Each TC has its own contention parameters (AIFS, CWmin, CWmax).
High-priority traffic (like voice) gets shorter wait times and better access to the channel.
