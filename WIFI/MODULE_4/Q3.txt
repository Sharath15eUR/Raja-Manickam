A. Management Plane Functionalities
The Management Plane handles all functions related to establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between wireless devices. 
The MAC layer supports the following management functions:
    1.	Scanning
    Actively or passively discovering available Access Points (APs) in the vicinity.
    2.	Authentication
    The initial process where a client (station) verifies itself to the AP using open or shared key authentication.
    3.	Association and Reassociation
    Allows the station to formally connect to an AP and receive a unique Association ID (AID). Reassociation occurs when a client moves to a different AP within the same ESS.
    4.	Disassociation
    Voluntarily ending the association between a client and an AP.
    5.	Deauthentication
    Termination of the authentication relationship, often triggered by security policy enforcement.
    6.	Beacon Transmission
    Periodic broadcast of beacon frames by the AP to advertise the network and its capabilities.
    7.	Probe Request and Response
    Used in active scanning; the client sends a probe request and receives probe responses from APs.
    8.	Capability Advertisement
    During management frame exchange, the AP and client advertise supported features such as encryption types, supported rates, etc.
    9.	Timing Synchronization
    Maintaining clock synchronization across all stations within the BSS using information in beacons.
    10.	Power Management Signaling
    The MAC layer manages transitions between active and power-save modes for clients.

B. Control Plane Functionalities
The Control Plane supports the delivery and coordination of frame transmissions, including access control, acknowledgment, and synchronization mechanisms.
    1.	RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send)
    Used to avoid collisions by reserving the channel before transmitting large data frames.
    2.	Acknowledgment (ACK) Frames
    Sent in response to received data frames to confirm successful reception.
    3.	Block ACK
    Enables acknowledgment of multiple frames in a single control frame, improving efficiency.
    4.	PS-Poll (Power Save Poll)
    A control frame sent by clients in power-save mode to request buffered data from the AP.
    5.	CF-End and CF-End + CF-ACK
    Used in Point Coordination Function (PCF) mode to indicate the end of the contention-free period.
    6.	NAV (Network Allocation Vector) Management
    A virtual carrier sensing mechanism to avoid collision based on the duration field in control frames.
    7.	Channel Access Coordination (DCF/EDCA/PCF/HCF)
    Implements various coordination functions to manage how and when a device may transmit, such as:
    - 	DCF: Distributed Coordination Function
    - 	EDCA: Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
    - 	PCF: Point Coordination Function
    - 	HCF: Hybrid Coordination Function (used in QoS networks)

C. Data Plane Functionalities
The Data Plane is responsible for the actual transfer of user data between devices over the wireless medium. The MAC layer ensures that this data is transmitted reliably and efficiently.
    1.	Data Frame Transmission and Reception
    Handling unicast, multicast, and broadcast data frames between clients and APs.
    2.	Frame Fragmentation and Reassembly
    Large frames are broken into smaller fragments to improve reliability and avoid retransmitting the entire frame if an error occurs.
    3.	QoS Support
    Data frames can be prioritized using different access categories (voice, video, best-effort, background) to ensure timely delivery for real-time traffic.
    4.	Encryption and Decryption
    Ensures confidentiality of data using mechanisms such as WEP, WPA2, or WPA3 at the MAC layer.
    5.	Retry and Retransmission Logic
    If no acknowledgment is received for a data frame, the MAC layer automatically retransmits the frame up to a defined limit.
    6.	Sequence Control
    Maintains the correct order of data frames using sequence numbers, and avoids duplication.
    7.	A-MSDU and A-MPDU Aggregation
    Data frames may be aggregated to reduce overhead and improve throughput.
