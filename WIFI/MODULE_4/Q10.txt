1. A-MSDU (Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit)
Definition:
A-MSDU aggregates multiple MSDUs (MAC Service Data Units) into a single MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit), allowing them to be transmitted together.
How It Works:
•	Each MSDU is a higher-layer data packet (e.g., from IP or TCP).
•	Multiple MSDUs are combined into the payload of a single MAC frame.
•	Only one MAC header is used for the whole aggregated payload.
•	All subframes (MSDUs) must have the same destination address and TID (Traffic Identifier).
Pros:
•	Reduces MAC header overhead (only one header per A-MSDU).
•	Efficient for small packets.
Cons:
•	If one MSDU is corrupted, the entire A-MSDU must be retransmitted.
•	Less robust than A-MPDU.

2. A-MPDU (Aggregated MAC Protocol Data Unit)
Definition:
A-MPDU aggregates multiple MPDUs, each with its own MAC header and CRC, into a single PHY-layer transmission unit.
How It Works:
•	Each MPDU can carry one MSDU or A-MSDU.
•	MPDUs are combined and sent together in a single PHY-layer frame.
•	Each MPDU is separated by a delimiter and has its own FCS.
•	Uses Block ACK to acknowledge successful MPDUs individually.
Pros:
•	More robust: if one MPDU is corrupted, only that MPDU needs retransmission.
•	Compatible with Block ACK.
•	Very efficient for high-throughput data.
Cons:
•	Slightly more overhead than A-MSDU due to individual MAC headers and FCS.

3. A-MSDU within A-MPDU (Nested Aggregation)
Definition:
This is a nested aggregation approach where each MPDU in an A-MPDU contains an A-MSDU instead of a single MSDU.
Why Use Nested Aggregation?
•	Combines the benefits of both methods:
	-	A-MSDU reduces header overhead.
	-	A-MPDU increases robustness with per-frame retransmissions.
•	Provides maximum efficiency for high-throughput scenarios.
Pros:
•	Highly efficient for large data bursts.
•	Per-MPDU retransmission while still reducing MAC header overhead within each A-MSDU.
Cons:
•	More complex to implement.
•	Slightly more processing required at both sender and receiver.
