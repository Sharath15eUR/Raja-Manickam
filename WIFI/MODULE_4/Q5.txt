The stages of client association includes five main stages:
1. Scanning Phase (Discovery)
Before a client can associate, it must discover available networks. This is done using either:
•	Passive Scanning: The client listens for beacon frames sent periodically by APs.
•	Active Scanning: The client sends probe request frames and receives probe response frames from APs.
At the end of this phase, the client builds a list of available Wi-Fi networks.

2. Authentication Phase
Once the client selects an AP to connect with, it initiates authentication, which is a simple identity check at this stage (in basic open-system or shared-key authentication).
There are two types of authentication in 802.11 (at this layer):
•	Open System Authentication:
    - 	No password exchange at this stage.
    - 	The AP allows any device to authenticate.
    - 	Commonly used in modern networks along with upper-layer security (like WPA2/WPA3).
•	Shared Key Authentication (deprecated):
    - 	Uses a pre-shared WEP key for challenge-response authentication.
    - 	Considered insecure and rarely used today.
Frames exchanged:
•	Authentication Request (from client to AP)
•	Authentication Response (from AP to client)

3. Association Phase
After successful authentication, the client must associate with the AP to begin data communication.
•	Association is the process of allocating resources at the AP for the client.
•	The client sends an Association Request frame.
    - 	Contains information like supported data rates, capabilities, SSID, etc.
•	The AP responds with an Association Response frame.
    - 	Confirms acceptance and provides an Association ID (AID) to identify the client.
If successful, the client is now logically connected to the AP and can begin data communication.

4. 802.1X / WPA2/3 Authentication (Optional – Higher Layer)
In secure networks (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3), additional authentication is performed using the 802.1X framework, which includes:
•	EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) for flexible, secure credential exchange.
•	RADIUS server for identity verification.
•	Once successful, a 4-Way Handshake is used to establish encryption keys.
This ensures the connection is secure and encrypted.

5. DHCP and IP Configuration (Layer 3 Process)
Although not part of the 802.11 MAC layer, the final step for network communication is:
•	Client sends a DHCP Discover request to get an IP address.
•	Once it receives a lease (IP address, gateway, DNS), the client is fully connected to the network.
