There are two main types of scanning processes:

A. Passive Scanning
Definition:
In passive scanning, the client listens silently for beacon frames that are periodically broadcast by APs on different channels.
Process:
1.	The client tunes to a channel and waits for a beacon frame from any AP on that channel.
2.	Beacons contain information such as:
    - 	SSID (Service Set Identifier)
    - 	BSSID (MAC address of AP)
    - 	Supported data rates
    - 	Security capabilities
    - 	Channel information
    - 	Timing information (for synchronization)
3.	The client collects this information to build a list of available networks.
4.	It then switches to the next channel and repeats the process until all desired channels have been scanned.
Characteristics:
•	No frame transmission from the client.
•	Stealthy and power-efficient.
•	Slower than active scanning due to waiting for beacon intervals (typically 100 ms).
•	Often used in environments where silent scanning is preferred (e.g., for power saving or stealth in monitoring tools).
Use Cases:
•	Mobile devices conserving battery.
•	Devices operating in regulatory domains that prohibit probe requests.
•	Sniffers or passive network analyzers.

B. Active Scanning
Definition:
In active scanning, the client actively sends probe request frames to solicit responses (probe responses) from APs.
Process:
1.	The client sends a probe request frame on a specific channel.
- 	This can include a specific SSID or a broadcast SSID (wildcard).
2.	All APs on that channel respond with a probe response frame, containing:
    - 	SSID
    - 	BSSID
    - 	Capabilities
    - 	Security settings
    - 	Beacon interval
    - 	Other network details
3.	The client collects the probe responses.
4.	It switches to the next channel and repeats the process.
Characteristics:
•	Faster than passive scanning since the client initiates communication.
•	More power-consuming due to active frame transmission.
•	Allows discovery of hidden SSIDs (APs that do not broadcast beacon SSIDs).
•	Slightly more bandwidth-intensive due to control traffic.
Use Cases:
•	Fast roaming in enterprise networks.
•	When quick discovery is prioritized over power saving.
•	Devices needing to find specific networks, including hidden ones.
