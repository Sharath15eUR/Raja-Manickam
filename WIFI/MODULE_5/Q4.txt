With Wi-Fi 6E, we now have access to a third band:
•	6 GHz (from 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz, depending on country regulations)
This 6 GHz band provides an additional 1200 MHz of spectrum (in regions like the US) — much more than what was available before.
Why is the 6 GHz Band Important?
1.	Massive Increase in Available Spectrum:
	-	The 2.4 GHz band is only 83.5 MHz wide, and the 5 GHz band offers about 500 MHz.
	-	In contrast, the 6 GHz band adds around 1200 MHz of fresh, uncluttered spectrum.
	-	This means more channels are available for Wi-Fi communication, especially wider channels like 80 MHz and 160 MHz, which are critical for high-speed data transmission.
2.	Less Congestion and Interference:
	-	The 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands are very crowded today because they are used by many other devices like Bluetooth gadgets, microwaves, cordless phones, etc.
	-	The 6 GHz band is reserved exclusively for Wi-Fi 6E and later devices, meaning there are fewer legacy devices and minimal interference.
	-	This results in cleaner, more reliable wireless connections.
3.	Supports Wider Channels (Higher Speeds):
	-	Wi-Fi speed is highly dependent on channel width.
	-	6 GHz allows the use of more 80 MHz and 160 MHz channels without overlap or interference.
	-	Wider channels mean more data can be transmitted at once, leading to gigabit-level Wi-Fi speeds and better performance for demanding applications like 4K/8K video streaming, AR/VR, and large file downloads.
4.	Lower Latency:
	-	Since there is less interference and congestion, data transmission happens faster and with fewer delays.
	-	Applications that require real-time responses (such as gaming, video conferencing, or VR) perform much better.
5.	Better for High-Density Environments:
	-	Places like stadiums, airports, large offices, and apartment complexes, where hundreds or thousands of devices are trying to connect, can benefit greatly from the extra spectrum.
	-	Devices can spread out across many more channels, reducing collisions and improving overall network performance.
6.	Only for Modern Devices:
	-	Only Wi-Fi 6E-compatible devices can operate in the 6 GHz band.
	-	Older devices (Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 4) cannot connect to 6 GHz networks.
	-	This ensures that networks using 6 GHz are populated only by high-performance, efficient Wi-Fi 6E devices, keeping the band clean and optimized.
Real-World Impact
•	In a home with many smart TVs, gaming consoles, laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices, 6 GHz Wi-Fi would allow these high-data-demand devices to operate with blazing speeds without slowing each other down.
•	In an enterprise or stadium environment, it allows thousands of devices to connect without bottlenecks.
