In Wi-Fi 6, the available frequency spectrum is divided into multiple Resource Units (RUs), each of which is a smaller sub-channel. A Resource Unit can be assigned to a single device for transmitting its data, and multiple devices can use different RUs within the same channel at the same time. For example, in a busy environment where many devices are connected to the same router, each device will transmit in its allocated RU without interfering with others.
This is different from Wi-Fi 5, where the entire channel is typically used by a single device at a time, even if that device doesn't use the full capacity of the channel. With Wi-Fi 6 and OFDMA, the channel is used more efficiently by allowing multiple devices to share it simultaneously.
Benefits of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6
1.	Improved Network Efficiency:
	-	In a typical Wi-Fi 5 network, when multiple devices are transmitting, the channel may be underutilized if only a few devices are sending data at a time. 
        OFDMA improves this by allowing multiple devices to transmit in parallel, which increases overall throughput and efficiency.
2.	Reduced Latency:
	-	OFDMA reduces latency by allowing data from multiple devices to be transmitted simultaneously, instead of waiting for one device to finish transmitting before the next device can begin. 
        This is particularly beneficial in high-density environments like offices, stadiums, or crowded neighborhoods, where multiple devices may need to communicate at the same time.
3.	Better Performance in High-Density Environments:
	-	In areas where many devices are connected (e.g., a crowded office or apartment complex), traditional Wi-Fi can suffer from congestion.
         OFDMA alleviates this problem by ensuring that the available bandwidth is distributed among devices, so each device can transmit its data more efficiently without waiting for others to finish.
4.	Better Support for IoT Devices:
	-	The Internet of Things (IoT) devices often require low data rates and do not need constant communication. 
        OFDMA can allocate smaller sub-channels to these devices, allowing them to transmit their small amounts of data without using up the entire channel.
        This reduces interference and conserves energy.
5.	Increased Throughput:
	-	By allowing multiple devices to transmit simultaneously on smaller sub-channels, the overall data throughput is increased. 
        The router can handle more devices, and the devices themselves can transmit data faster because they donâ€™t need to wait for other devices to finish before they start sending their own data.
