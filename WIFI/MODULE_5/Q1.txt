Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)
Wi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, is an upgrade over Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac). The key features of Wi-Fi 6 include:
1.	OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access):
	-	Allows multiple devices to use the same channel simultaneously by dividing the channel into smaller sub-channels. 
        This reduces congestion and improves network efficiency, especially in high-density environments.
2.	MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input, Multiple Output):
	-	With Wi-Fi 5, MU-MIMO was limited to downstream traffic (router to device).
         Wi-Fi 6 improves this by supporting both upstream and downstream MU-MIMO, allowing the router to communicate with multiple devices simultaneously.
3.	1024-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):
	-	Wi-Fi 6 supports 1024-QAM, which increases the data rate by encoding more data per signal. 
        This leads to a higher throughput compared to Wi-Fi 5, which only supports 256-QAM.
4.	Target Wake Time (TWT):
	-	TWT helps IoT devices save power by scheduling when they need to wake up and communicate with the router. 
        This is particularly useful for devices that don't need to be active all the time, such as smart home devices.
5.	Increased Speed:
	-	Wi-Fi 6 offers faster data rates, with theoretical speeds of up to 9.6 Gbps, compared to Wi-Fi 5's maximum of 3.5 Gbps.
6.	Improved Range:
	-	Wi-Fi 6 has better range than Wi-Fi 5 due to more efficient use of radio frequency (RF) resources and the ability to operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

Wi-Fi 6E
Wi-Fi 6E is an extension of Wi-Fi 6 that introduces support for the 6 GHz frequency band. 
While Wi-Fi 6 operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, Wi-Fi 6E can also operate in the 6 GHz band, offering several key benefits:
1.	6 GHz Spectrum:
	-	The 6 GHz band provides additional channels for Wi-Fi, which reduces congestion and interference in crowded environments (e.g., apartments, offices). 
        This provides more bandwidth for faster speeds and more reliable connections.
2.	More Channels:
	-	The 6 GHz band offers up to 1200 MHz of additional spectrum, compared to only 500 MHz in the 5 GHz band. 
        This additional bandwidth allows for more channels, improving network capacity and performance.
3.	Lower Latency:
	-	The 6 GHz band has less interference because it’s less crowded. 
        As a result, Wi-Fi 6E can offer lower latency, which is beneficial for high-demand applications like gaming and real-time video streaming.
4.	Backward Compatibility:
	-	Devices that support Wi-Fi 6E are backward compatible with Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5, but they can take advantage of the 6 GHz band when communicating with Wi-Fi 6E-compatible routers.

Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)
Wi-Fi 7 is the latest Wi-Fi standard and is designed to offer even higher speeds, lower latency, and better efficiency. Some of the key features of Wi-Fi 7 include:
1.	320 MHz Channels:
	-	Wi-Fi 7 supports 320 MHz-wide channels (double the 160 MHz channels in Wi-Fi 6), which allows for much faster data rates and better performance, especially in high-density environments.
2.	4096-QAM:
	-	Wi-Fi 7 supports 4096-QAM, further increasing the data rate compared to Wi-Fi 6’s 1024-QAM.
         This allows for even faster speeds and higher throughput.
3.	Multi-Link Operation (MLO):
	-	Wi-Fi 7 introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), which allows devices to use multiple channels across different frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) simultaneously. 
        This improves throughput and reduces latency by dynamically selecting the best channels.
4.	Enhanced MU-MIMO:
	-	Wi-Fi 7 enhances MU-MIMO technology, supporting up to 16 simultaneous users in both uplink and downlink directions (compared to 8 in Wi-Fi 6), which improves overall network capacity and efficiency.
5.	Lower Latency:
	-	Wi-Fi 7 focuses on reducing latency for applications like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). 
        It achieves this by allowing faster transmission of data through wider channels and improved scheduling.
6.	Faster Speeds:
	-	Wi-Fi 7 is expected to support speeds up to 30 Gbps, which is significantly faster than Wi-Fi 6’s 9.6 Gbps.
