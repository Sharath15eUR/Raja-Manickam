Explain the concept of Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) and its benefit in mobile environments

802.11r, also known as Fast Basic Service Set Transition (Fast BSS Transition or FT), is a Wi-Fi enhancement designed to speed up the handoff process when a wireless device (like a smartphone or laptop) moves from one access point (AP) to another within the same Wi-Fi network. This transition happens in environments where multiple APs are deployed under the same SSID (network name), such as campuses, hospitals, large offices, or malls.

--Why is 802.11r Needed?
In traditional Wi-Fi networks, when a device moves out of range of one access point and into the range of another, it has to go through the entire authentication process again. This process includes full authentication with the new AP, performing a four-way handshake, and generating new encryption keys.
This full process can take several hundred milliseconds. While that may be fine for casual browsing, it causes problems in real-time applications like VoIP (voice over IP), video conferencing, online gaming, and streaming, where even a small delay or interruption can result in noticeable issues like lag, dropped calls, or buffering.

--How Does 802.11r Work?
802.11r reduces handoff time by allowing devices to perform key exchanges and authentication in advance, even before they connect to a new AP. This is called Fast Transition.

Here’s how it works in a step-by-step flow:

The device connects to the current AP using normal WPA2 or WPA3 authentication (either with a pre-shared key or using 802.1X with a RADIUS server).
After the initial connection, the device and the AP generate a Pairwise Master Key (PMK).
From this PMK, a new key hierarchy is created that includes a Fast Transition Key (FTK).
This FTK is shared with nearby APs within the same network so that when the client device moves, it doesn't have to renegotiate everything from scratch.
When the client is ready to roam to a new AP, it uses the FTK to perform a fast handshake, allowing the connection to continue almost instantly and securely.

--Two Modes of Operation in 802.11r
There are two modes by which Fast BSS Transition can happen:

Over-the-Air FT: The device directly performs the fast transition handshake with the new AP it wants to connect to.
Over-the-DS (Distribution System) FT: The device communicates with the new AP through its current AP, which acts as a relay.

Both modes aim to reduce delay during roaming.

--Benefits of 802.11r in Mobile Environments:

Fast Handoff: Roaming time is reduced to less than 50 milliseconds, sometimes as fast as 20 milliseconds, which is almost unnoticeable to the user.
Seamless Connectivity: Real-time applications such as Wi-Fi calling, video streaming, and online gaming continue without interruption as the device moves.
Better User Experience: There are no dropped calls, frozen video feeds, or re-authentication delays when moving around.
Power Efficiency: Devices spend less time scanning and re-authenticating, which helps save battery life.
Supports Real-Time and Enterprise Apps: In office, healthcare, or warehouse environments where users are always moving, 802.11r ensures that mobile applications and VoIP calls function reliably.

--Real-World Scenarios Where 802.11r Is Useful

A doctor using a wireless headset during hospital rounds can continue the call seamlessly while moving across floors.
A student attending an online lecture on Zoom while walking from one part of campus to another doesn’t get disconnected.
A warehouse worker with a barcode scanner that relies on instant data uploads doesn’t face delays while walking through different aisles.
A person playing online games or using AR/VR can continue uninterrupted even while moving through rooms in a large house or office.
