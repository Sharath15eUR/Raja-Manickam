Target Wake Time is a feature that allows a device and the Wi-Fi access point (router) to negotiate and schedule specific times when the device will wake up to send or receive data.
Instead of having devices always listening to the Wi-Fi channel and constantly checking if there is any data for them (which consumes a lot of battery power), TWT pre-arranges exact times for communication. 
This lets the device sleep most of the time and only wake up when needed.
How TWT Works
•	The access point and the device agree on a schedule (wake time).
•	Between these wake times, the device can remain in a low-power sleep mode.
•	When the agreed time comes, the device wakes up, quickly exchanges data, and then goes back to sleep.
This scheduling optimizes the power usage and reduces channel congestion because fewer devices are awake and competing for the channel at the same time.
Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) for IoT Devices
1.	Significant Power Savings:
	-	IoT devices like smart sensors, smart locks, thermostats, and health trackers often have small batteries.
	-	Constantly keeping the Wi-Fi radio on drains battery quickly. TWT allows these devices to sleep for long periods, only waking up when necessary, drastically extending their battery life.
2.	Improved Network Efficiency:
	-	In dense IoT environments (like smart homes or smart factories), thousands of devices may be connected to the same access point.
	-	If every device tries to access the channel randomly, it causes collisions and re-transmissions, which reduce overall efficiency.
	-	TWT ensures that devices wake up at different, scheduled times, avoiding collisions and reducing network congestion.
3.	Reduced Latency for Scheduled Communication:
	-	Since devices know exactly when they are scheduled to communicate, data transmission becomes more predictable and efficient.
	-	For time-sensitive applications (like alarms or critical monitoring devices), this predictability ensures data is sent and received quickly when needed.
4.	Better Scalability for IoT Deployments:
	-	TWT allows Wi-Fi networks to support a much larger number of devices because each device does not need to be active all the time.
	-	This makes Wi-Fi 6 ideal for large-scale IoT applications, such as smart cities, industrial IoT, smart grids, and healthcare monitoring systems.
5.	Flexible Scheduling:
	-	Devices can negotiate different wake schedules depending on their needs.
	-	For example, a temperature sensor might wake up every 10 minutes, while a security camera might wake up more frequently or stay awake longer during certain times.
