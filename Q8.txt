1.ifconfig:
    1.	Displays details of active network interfaces.
    2.	Configures IP addresses, subnet masks, and broadcast addresses.
    3.	Enables or disables network interfaces.
    4.	Shows transmitted and received packets, errors, and collisions.
    5.	Supports changing MAC addresses and MTU size.

    Example Commands:
        1.	View network interfaces and assigned IP addresses: 
            ifconfig
        2.	Assign an IP address to an interface: 
            sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
        3.	Enable or disable an interface: 
            sudo ifconfig eth0 up   # Enable
            sudo ifconfig eth0 down # Disable
        4.	Change the MAC address of an interface: 
            sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:
            
2.iwconfig:
It is used to configure and manage wireless network interfaces. 
Unlike ifconfig, which deals with all network interfaces, iwconfig focuses only on Wi-Fi settings.

    1.	Displays and modifies wireless network parameters.
    2.	Shows SSID, frequency, signal strength, and link quality.
    3.	Configures Wi-Fi mode (Managed, Ad-hoc, Monitor, etc.).
    4.	Adjusts transmission power 
    5.	Useful for troubleshooting wireless connectivity.

    Example Commands
    1.	View wireless network details: 
        iwconfig
    2.	Set the SSID of a wireless network: 
        sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "MyNetwork"
    3.	Set the mode of operation (Managed, Monitor, Ad-hoc): 
        sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode Managed
    4.	Check signal strength and link quality: 
        iwconfig wlan0


1.MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit): The largest size (in bytes) of a packet that can be sent over the network interface.The default value is 1500 bytes for Ethernet.
    Change MTU:
    sudo ifconfig eth0 mtu 1400
2.Interface speed : The rate at which data is transmitted over a network interface (measured in Mbps or Gbps).
    iwconfig wlan0
