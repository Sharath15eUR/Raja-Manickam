A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a network.
This helps devices communicate without needing manual configuration.

Process:
    1.Discovery: Client sends DHCPDISCOVER request.
    2.Offer: Server responds with an IP offer (DHCPOFFER).
    3.Request: Client requests the offered IP (DHCPREQUEST).
    4.Acknowledgment: Server assigns IP and confirms (DHCPACK).
    
The process follows a DORA (Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge) sequence:

1.DHCP Discover (Broadcast from Client)
    1.When a new device (client) connects to the network, it does not have an IP address.
    2.The device broadcasts a DHCP Discover message across the network, looking for a DHCP server.

2.DHCP Offer (Server Responds)
    1.The DHCP server receives the Discover message and checks its available IP address pool.
    2.It sends a DHCP Offer to the client, suggesting an available IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.

3.DHCP Request (Client Accepts)
    1.The client responds with a DHCP Request, confirming that it accepts the offered IP address.

4.DHCP Acknowledge (Server Confirms)
    1.The DHCP server sends a DHCP Acknowledge (ACK) message, confirming the lease of the IP address to the client.
    2.The client now has a valid IP address, and it can communicate on the network.
